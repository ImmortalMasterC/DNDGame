Muddle
------

	Muddle is a MUD client written by Brett Vickers (bvickers@uci.edu)
to use with Mordor (mud server).  It will work with many other types of
mud servers as well.  Everything is included here that is necessary for
you to create your own binary version.  It supports multiple connections,
macros, and limited bot capabilities. 

	This software is known to work on SunOS 4.0, FreeBSD, and Linux.
Just type 'make' and you should shortly have a working version.
	This program looks for a file named '.muddle' which configures 
your sites, macros, and bots.  Use the sample.muddle file as a template 
for your personalized .muddle.	
	If you find this program useful, drop Brett a note thanking him 
for his efforts.  If you have questions about this distribution, mail 
brooke@moria.bio.uci.edu.
Here is some quick documentation:

Copy sample.muddle to a file called .muddle in your root directory.
Edit as appropriate.

At the muddle> prompt, hit ? for a list of commands and functions.

Once in the game, any of these commands can be achieved by typing
the command with a # in front of it.   So typing #l will list all
open connections.

Once you're connected, you can send commands to any connection you
have open at the time by typing #, the connection number, and the
command.  For example: #2 kill dog

To make another connection the active connection (i.e. the one that
displays to your screen), type a # followed by the connection number
and hit return.  Example: #3

To do a macro listed in your .muddle file, just type the key word.
