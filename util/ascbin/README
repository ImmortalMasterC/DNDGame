  This is an old (by Mordor standards) and very useful utility.  This 
allows you to convert your database from binary form into ascii.  This 
will let you change the struct, then convert your old database to the
new form of struct.
It can also be used to port databases to other architectures.
It should reside in ~/util/ascbin and will compile using the headers 
contained in your source tree.  The binary was compiled under Linux 
2.0.29.

  It operates in 2 modes:

Binary to Ascii:
  Most of the datafiles in Mordor are binary format.  You can convert 
them to ascii with --

	ab b [r|p|c|o] ascfile binfile
 
  This will convert the binary room, player, creature, or object file 
to ascii.  The ascii file can then be turned back to binary with --

	ab a ascfile

HOWTO

There is a program located in /util/ascbin called ab.  After it is
compiled, it should be located in the mordor bin directory.
Make backup files for everything that is to be converted.

cd to /objmon 
type "ab b p <ascfile> ../player/<playerfile>" for each player.

type "ab b c <ascfile> <mfile>"  for each binary group such as 
m00, m01 etc.
You will get a final error message - but the asc is ok!

Now change mstruct.h:
	- I changed daily to 25,
	- lasttime to 90,
	- and added "long bank_bal;" after "rom_num".
Note: any additions to the struct should go at the bottom of the struct.
make clean; make

Now you can convert the ascii files back to binary.
type "ab a <ascfile>"
ATTENTION: ab always creates m00!  So be sure to convert the highest
ascii file first, and then rename m00 to the correct m-file.
Continue doing so for all monster and player files.
Don't use any extern files before you have recompiled them.

Not sure, but I think this is the case....  When you convert the files
to binary, the ab program you use must be compiled with the same mstruct.h
that was used to build the binary program.  Then, after you have modified
the mstruct.h file, re-compile the ab program and use the new ab program
to convert the ascii file back to binary.  This will create a new binary
which uses the new, modified struct.
