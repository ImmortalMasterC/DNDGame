	PREPARE

The prepare command is used when you know the next room you're going 
to walk into has a trap in it.  If you prepare before entering a 
room, you will almost always avoid any trap in that room (unless 
your dexterity is really poor).  Prepare only lasts until you enter 
the next room, and you can only use it once every 15 seconds.
