	PRAY

Pray is a skill given to clerics, paladins and monks.  When the prayers
of clerics and paladins are heard by Alith, they are given additional piety. 
The player will have extra piety for about five minutes or so allowing the
the player to heal faster.  He will also be attacked less by monsters during 
that time.
When monks pray, their prayers are heard by either Alith or Zeth, depending
on the player's alignment.  Evil prayers are heard by Zeth.  In either case,
a monk's hands are sanctified for a short time which allows him to attack
and kill a monster that otherwise could only be killed by an enchanted
weapon.
