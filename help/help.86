	PREP

This class skill allows experienced Druids to make herbal concoctions 
that can harm, heal, or cure.  The type of concoction depends upon the 
type of herb prepared.  During the preparation process, the druid may not 
attack, nor wield a weapon, and they must hold the herbs that they are 
preparing until they are complete.
