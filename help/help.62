	TURN <monster> [#]

Turn is a special ability that is given to paladins and clerics.  
When attacking undead creatures (like ghosts, vampires, etc.) a 
cleric or paladin may try to turn a monster.  If successful, the 
monster is stripped of half its hit points or possibly even killed 
instantly.  This is a powerful weapon.  Success depends on the 
difference in levels between the player and monster as well as piety.
