	TALK <monster> [#] [<keyword>]
	ASK <monster> [#] [<keyword>]

Talk or ask allows you to communicate with certain monsters.  Some 
monsters can carry on interactive conversations.  If you supply a 
keyword, (usually one of the words in the monster's previous sentences.)
the monster may be able to give you some more information about it.

If you are hidden and you talk, your status will change and you will no
longer be hidden from view.

Example:

: talk scribe
The scribe says to you, "<Yawn> You bore me."
: ask scribe bore
The scribe says to you, "Yes, you are a boring fellow.  I see no reason
   to continue a rational discussion with you."
