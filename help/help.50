	CIRCLE <player/monster> [#]

The circle command allows fighters and barbarians to run circles 
about an opponent, causing them to be confused for several seconds.  
Any monster that is circled will not be able to attack or defend 
for a few seconds, giving you a slight tactical advantage.  Circle 
is most useful in groups.
