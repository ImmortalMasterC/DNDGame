	TRADE <item> <monster>

With this command you can TRADE items from your inventory to a creature.  
Do NOT make the mistake of GIVING something to the creature, else he 
will take it and give you nothing in return.  Also, there are only a
limited number of items which the creature is willing to trade for.  
He will generally tell you what he is willing to trade if you talk to
him.  (Which is a good idea, anyway.)
