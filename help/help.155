	This allows you to append or delete the Mordor newspaper. 
The 'd' flag clears the newspaper, and the 'a' flag allows you to 
append to the bottom of the newspaper.  A single period (.) on a 
line by itself will terminate the appending of text.  (See the 
related NEWS command.)

example:

:*news a
-> NEWS FOR NEW PLAYERS
-> Speak to the Flower Lady for directions to training sites.
