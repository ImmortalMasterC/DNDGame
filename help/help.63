	BRIBE <monster> $<amount>

Bribe allows you to offer monsters money in the hope that they will 
leave the room, not bothering you anymore.  This is useful if you 
want a monster to stop guarding a treasure you'd like to take or if 
you're really getting womped in the middle of combat.  The higher 
the level, the more money the monster will want.

: bribe criminal $50
The criminal takes your money, but stays.

: bribe criminal $200
The criminal takes your money, shakes your hand and leaves.


Some monsters are passive guards to a locked room and may be bribed
to open it.  There should be only one exit in a particular room that
is affected, so the syntax remains the same.  You do not have to 
specify the door you want opened.  The minimum bribe to open a door
is $100 gold.
