	SELL <object> [#]

You may only sell things you have in your inventory while in a pawn 
shoppe.  There are several pawn shoppes in the game, but be aware 
that they are usually hidden.  Look carefully at room descriptions 
to find clues on how to get there.  And remember to use the SEARCH 
command!
Once you find a pawn shoppe, you may sell any item you have that is 
not broken or too cheap.  The shoppekeeper will not give you more 
than 10000 gold pieces for any one item, so if it is actually worth 
more, then you'll just have to settle for lessi or sell it to the 
highest bidder.  To find out how much money the shoppekeeper will 
give you an item before you actually sell it, use the command:
