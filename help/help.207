	SLIT
	
This talent can only be used by assassins.
An assassin can slit the throat of an unwary opponent for great damage, 
but best results are achieved if the assassiin is hidden at the beginning 
of the battle.  This action cannot be used during a fight.  Also, the 
damage it inflicts increases with the assassin's level.

Example:

: slit dwarf
