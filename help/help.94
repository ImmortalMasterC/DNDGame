	FASTEN/UNFASTEN <container> [#] [with] <key name> [#]

The FASTEN or UNFASTEN command allows you to fasten or unfasten a 
locked container if you have the appropriate key.  The container
can be either in your inventory or on the floor in the room.  If
you have a container in your inventory of the same name as one on
the floor, the one in your inventory will be used first.

inventory, not the one on the floor.  If you want to unfasten the one
on the floor, you must specify mahogany chest 2.
