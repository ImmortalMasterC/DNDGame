        *MONSTER [#] [p|n] [#]

        This command creates a monster in the parent room.  If no number
is specified, then it creates one at random from the random list for the
parent room.  
	If the 'p' flag is given then a prototype monster is loaded.  Use 
the prototype if you intend to make permanent changes to the database, 
since this insures that the inventory is properly set.   
	If the 'n' flags is given followed by a number then the specified
number of monster will appear. 

example:
:*monster 105
The Fenris Wolf just arrived.
The Fenris Wolf attacks you.
:*mon 4 n 4
Four noblemen just arrived.
:*mon 4 p
Loading prototype creature.
A noblemen just arrived.
