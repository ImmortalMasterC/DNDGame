	TEACH <character> <spell>

This command can be used only by mages, clerics and druids to 
teach others particular spells.  Mages may only teach the four 
basic offensive spells, one from each realm, while clerics and 
druids may teach spells related to their calling.  The teacher 
earns experience points for such a kindness.
