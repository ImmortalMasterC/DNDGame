	*ONAME <object> [#] [-dok] <name>

	Allows a DM to change the name, description, output string, or key 
words of an object.  The action does not affect objects in the database, but 
only changes the one item.  However, the changed item can be saved as a new 
object in the database with the *save o <object-name> <index> command. 

example:
: *on sword -k2 red
Key done.
	{sets the second key on the sword to red}

:*on sword -d It's a red sword covered in blood.
Description done.
	{sets the description of the sword} 

:*on sword -o It's pretty heavy.
Output String done.
	{sets the output string on the sword}

:*on sword sabre
Name done.
	{changes the name from sword to sabre}
