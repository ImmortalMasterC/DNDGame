	PLEAD <monster> [#]

This command allows a player to plead for mercy from an opponent. 
If the plea is granted, the monster stops attacking.   There is
a loss of experience for the player, but not as much as the loss
would be if the player died.  

The chance of the monster granting mercy increases as the level of
the monster exceeds the level of the player, and decreases when the
monster's level is below that of the player.

For players less than level 10, the loss is approximately 2% of 
their total experience.  For level 10 and above the loss is only 1%.   

Alith considers such acts of mercy on the part of the monster worthy 
of a reward.

NOTE:  The word "mercy" can be substituted for the word "plead."
