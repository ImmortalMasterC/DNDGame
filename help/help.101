	*TELEPORT <room # | player > [ player2 | . ]

	This is the DM mode of transit.  You can teleport to anyone, or to 
any room.  You can also use this to teleport a player directly to you, 
to a specified room number, or to another player.  Teleporting to a 
negative number (any negative number) will return you to the last room 
from which you teleported.

examples:
:*teleport gonzo 
	{You arrive in a room with Gonzo}
:*teleport gonzo .
	{Gonzo arrives in the room you are in, not unlike a summon}
:*teleport gonzo mithrandir
	{Gonzo is teleported to the room Mithrandir is in}
:*teleport gonzo 677 
	{Gonzo is teleported to room number 677}
:*t 34
	{You teleport to room number 34}
:*t -1
	{You teleport back to the last room you teleported from}
