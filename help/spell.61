spell.61

freeze:
This spell allows the caster to freeze another player or creature
such that they cannot move.  If a resist-cold spell is cast on a
player who has been frozen, then the resist-cold spell acts as a 
thaw spell, and releases the player from frozen immobility.  
(Note:  Any of the fire realm offensive spells will also dissipate
the freeze spell, but are damaging.)

Monsters that breath frost can occasionally freeze a player if the 
player is not prepared and is not under a resist-cold spell.
