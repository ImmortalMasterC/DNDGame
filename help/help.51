	BASH <monster/player> [#]

This command allows barbarians to bash an opponent, knocking the foe 
to the floor for several seconds.  Bash does more damage than a regular
attack and it also causes the opponent to be delayed for several seconds 
while trying to get up off the floor.  This, in effect, gives the player 
the initiative for further attacks.  The ability to bash can only be used
at the beginning of combat.
