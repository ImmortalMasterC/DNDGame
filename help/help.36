	STEAL <object> [from] <player/monster> [#]

Thieves may steal objects from monsters or other players.  If they 
are successful, the victim will not even know he or she was stolen 
from.  However, if unsuccessful, the victim is warned.  Monsters 
usually get quite angry when someone tries to steal from them.

CAUTION:  Just because you CAN steal from other players, don't abuse 
          it.  Its easy to become a real jerk and make enemies you 
          don't need.
