evil-eye:
	This command allows you to cast an evil-eye spell on yourself
or another player.  If cast on another player, both the caster and
and the target must be chaotic.  If cast on one's self, the result
is different depending on your alignment.  If you are evil, the spell
will increase your ability to hit.  (You won't miss as often.) 
However, if you are good, it will have the opposite affect, and you
will miss your opponent much more often.  The spell may be removed 
from yourself with a bless spell.  If the evil-eye spell is cast on
another chaotic player, the target will be clumsy and will often miss
his/her opponent during battle. It also slows you down.
