	SAVE

This command saves your character to file.  It is always a good idea 
to do this every once in a while, because sometimes the game will 
crash, and all progress since the time of the last save (or login) 
will be lost.  A player is automatically save periodically, and is 
always saved after dropping/giving gold or items in inventory.
