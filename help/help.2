	LOOK [<object/creature> [#]]
	EXAMINE [<object/creature> [#]]
	LOOK <player>

When typed by itself, LOOK or EXAMINE will show you the description 
of the room in which you are currently standing.  If you include a 
second word after the command, such as an object, creature or player, 
you will look at that.  If there are two or more items at which to 
look, be sure to specify the number.  If you look at an item in your 
inventory, the description of the item will be preceded by a plus 
sign.  If you look at an item you are holding/wielding/wearing, the 
description will be preceded by an asterisk.  If there is neither a 
plus sign nor an asterisk, then the item is on the floor.

Suppose you have two bags in your inventory and are also holding a 
like bag.  If there is the same kind of bag on the floor, there are 
four bags.  Further, suppose all of the bags are empty except the
one you are holding.  The order in which you will see them is:  
	inventory - wield/wear/hold - floor.
