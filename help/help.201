	RESCUE <player> <monster>

The RESCUE command allows one player to step into a fight between a 
monster and another player.  For any rescuer except a paladin, there 
is a 50% chance that the monster will stop attacking the player being 
rescued, but a 100% chance that the monster will begin attacking the 
rescuer.  For paladins, the chance of success will be greater than 
50% depending on the paladin's level and goodness.  Paladins also
gain a small amount of experience for rescues.
Evil players will move toward good alignment unless the player being
rescued is also evil, then there is no change in alignment status.
