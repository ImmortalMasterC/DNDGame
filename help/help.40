	RECITE <object> [#] [on] [<player/monster/object> [#]]
	   USE <object> [#] [on] [<player/monster/object> [#]]

The recite command allows you to USE a scroll, thereby causing the 
spell contained on the scroll to be cast.  RECITE is different from 
STUDY in that the spell is actually cast when you recite or use the 
scroll, but you do not learn the spell.  It is different from CAST 
because no magic points are required to recite a scroll, and you do 
not have to know the spell to recite it.

You have: a black scroll.
: recite scroll to rat
You cast a hurt spell on the rat for 7 damage.
The black scroll disintegrates.
