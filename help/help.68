	IGNORE [player]

The ignore command allows you to ignore flashes (sends, tells) 
from other players in the game.  If typed without an argument, 
the list of people you are ignoring will be displayed.  If typed 
with a player's name, that player will be added to your ignore 
list if he or she is not already on it.  Otherwise the name is 
removed from the list.
