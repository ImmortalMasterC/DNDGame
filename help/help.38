	CAST <spell> [on] [<player/monster/object> [#]]

The cast command allows you to cast spells which you may have 
learned by studying or reading scrolls.  The INFO command will 
tell you which spells you currently know.  Different spells cost 
different amounts of magic points.
When you cast a spell, the magic points are subtracted, and the 
special magic effect is produced.  Unlike other MUDs, this one 
allows all classes to cast spells.  Of course, some classes get 
more magic points than others.  
To cast a spell on yourself, do not include a target.
