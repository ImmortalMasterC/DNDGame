INTRODUCTION
	Darbonne is a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) based on the Mordor code
written by Brett Vickers, with extensions by Steve Smith and Brooke Paul,
Roy Wilson and many others.  It is a real time game in which you can 
interact with other players.   The following is a brief explanation of 
important commands and topics needed to enjoy this game.  Some commands 
have multiple equivalents and they will be listed with commas separating 
them.  Variable arguments will be listed via <argument>, but you should 
not type the <> brackets.  

COMMAND LINE
	The game is command line driven, with a colon as its normal prompt.  
The command interpreter is an intelligent one.  Commands may be given in 
upper and/or lowercase letters.  An abbreviation of a command and its 
arguments may be used.  If the abbreviation is not a unique command, more 
information (letters) must be typed.

HELP
	Online help can be summoned by issuing the command 'help <command>'.  
If a command argument is given, specific information on that argument will 
be listed, otherwise all the available commands will be listed.

COMMUNICATION
	Since Darbonne is a multi-user game, there needs to be some way
to talk to other players.  If you wish to see who is currently logged on,
type the word "who."  The following commands are used for communication:

	To talk to all of the players in the same room, there are three
different methods:  Choose the one you are most comfortable with.  You may
type the word "say" followed by your <message>, or you can use either a
single quote or a double quote followed by your <message>.

	If you type the word "yell" followed by your <message> the message 
will be sent to all the players in the same room and adjoining rooms.

	If you type the word "tell" or the word "send" followed by the
arguments <player> <message>,  the message will be sent to only the 
specific player identified.  The target player does not have to be in the
same room with you.

	You can broadcast a message to the entire game and all players
currently logged on.  Type the word "broadcast" followed by <message>. 
A five broadcast per day quota is imposed on each character.  There is
also a global emote command.  Use channelemote <message>.

	If you are a member of a group, you can use grouptalk <message>,
 which allows you to address your remarks to the entire group of adventurers.

	There is a classsend command, which allows you to communicate with
other players of the same class, such as thief, mage, etc.  You can also use
classemote <message> for emote messages to members of your class.

	Please try to refrain from profanity, as young children have access  
to our game.  (Too much profanity, and you will piss off the Dungeon Master.)

MOVEMENT
	To move from one place to another, you may use the "go" command,
or simply type the direction itself.
Direction is any valid exit from the current room, which may be visible, 
hidden, or invisible.  Examples are "go temple", "go pub", "go door".
	Instead of typing "go <direction>" all the time, certain directions 
may be given as the command itself.  These command directions include "north", 
"south", "east", "west", "northwest", "northeast", "southwest", "southeast", 
"left", "right", "forward", "back", "up", "down" and "out."  One or two letters
of each of these command directions may be used as a special abbreviation.  
For example, use "n" instead of "north" (or instead of "go north") and "ne" 
instead of "northeast".

INVENTORY/OBJECTS
	Each character is able to carry a limited amount of weight.
Objects in the game include weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, gold, torches,
keys, and other items.  Each item (except gold) has a specific weight value.  
A character may not carry more than he/she can handle, which depends on 
his/her class, strength, and level.  Unlike other MUD's, you will retain all 
of your inventory each time you log on/off.
	Type the word "inventory" to list all items currently in your 
character's possession, but not worn, held, or wielded.  You may abbreviate
with just the letter 'i'.
	If you type the word "equipment", it will list all items currently 
worn, held, or wielded.  You can abbreviate with 'equi'.
	You will often want to get items you see that have been dropped.
Use the command  "get <item> [#] [from] [<item2>] [#]".
Example no. 1:  get sword  (get the first sword on the floor and add it
	to your inventory.  If you want to use it, be sure to WIELD it.)
Example no. 2: get mace 2  (If there are two maces on the floor, this command
	allows you to get the second one.)
Example no. 3:  get mask from bag  (If you previously put the mask in a bag
	you can retrieve it.  Note the word 'from' is not really necessary.)
IMPORTANT: Refer to objects with only one name.  For example, if you
wish to get some cloth armor, type "get armor" or "get cloth".  (either
will work.)   Do not type "get cloth armor" because the code will consider 
the armor as a container from which you want to get cloth.
	You may "drop" <item> which will remove the <item> from the your
inventory and place it on the floor in the current room.  You can also
drop all.
	Armor: an object which is worn on a specific part of a character's 
body which contributes towards Armor Class (AC) value. Low numbers are best. 
"wear <item>" will attempt to wear a specific item, and will succeed if it
is an armor item and no other item is worn in its spot. Also, the item must
not be broken.  "wear all" is a shortcut which attempts to wear all the items 
in your inventory.  (in the order that they appear).

*** HINTS FOR THE NEW PLAYER
	There are several recommendations for a new player:

	1. You may want to suicide your character and start over after you
read the Book of Knowledge.  The book contains helpful information concerning
the best classes, races and stats for a new character.  Also, your first 
character should be made Lawful.  Darbonne can be a violent place for the 
chaotic player, and it is best to become famililar with the game and its 
commands before attempting to challenge other players.
	2. Use the _set_ command to set some of your character's parameters. 
These parameters, and their current settings, can be found by typing 'set' 
and 'help set' at the command prompt.
	3. When encountering a new monster, be sure to _look_ at it 
before anything else (unless it is attacking you).  At the lower levels 
there are very few monsters that will attack you first, so it is usually 
safe to 'look' at them.  The information you gain from looking will tell 
you if the monster is an opponent that you can handle.  It will also let 
you know if it is a good idea to talk to them.  Many of the monsters can 
talk interactively and will provide vital information about the game.  
Some will attack you if you talk to them so you need to look first and 
then decide if it is safe to talk.
	4.  The information you gain from reading the full room descriptions 
will save you much grief and time.  After you pass level 3, you may elect
too 'clear long' if you no longer wish the long room descriptions to be
displayed.  However, if you go into a new area, be sure to 'set long' again.
	
		*** HINTS TO GET TO LEVEL 2 ***
NOTE: You must get to level two within a month or so in order for the 
character to be saved permanently.

	Low level players should not attempt areas outside Darbonne until at
least level 4 or by grouping with other players.  Attack easy monsters
such as students, scribes, monks, merchants, laborers, and vagrants.  This
can be accomplished by just hanging out at the park or pubs. It's not 
recommended that you attack without full hitpoints.  Remember that you must 
constantly attack with "k <monster>" every 3 seconds or so.  Monsters will 
remember their enemies, so if you attack one and flee (in which case you 
drop your wielded weapon), it will attack you if you come back to that place.  
A good strategy as a level 1 player is to not worry about getting killed,
but to use your time to explore and become familiar with the city.  
The general rule is _look_ and _talk_ before attacking, and above all: 
BE CAREFUL. 

If you have ANY questions or problems, first try asking a Caretaker. If
one is not available, ask one of the Dungeonmasters.  If you are unable 
to talk to them online, you can always leave them mail with your questions.  
Just go to one of the post offices located around the city.
