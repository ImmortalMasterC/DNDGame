	*REPLACE [-sD] [str1] [str2]

	This function will search and replace [str1] for [str2].  Due to 
the parsing of [str1] it can only be one word long, however [str2] can be 
any length.  If the -s flag is set, the replace will be done in the short
description only.  If the -D flag is set then [str2] is ommitted and [str1]
will be deleted.
	NOTE:  This function does not reformat the text after replacement.
