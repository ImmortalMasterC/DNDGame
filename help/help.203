	CLEAR_SCREEN
	CS

This command is used to clear the screen.  The two letters cs 
can be used as an abbreviation.  The cleared screen is only 
temporary as new information will continue to scroll across the 
display, but if you don't want someone looking over your shoulder, 
at least you can clear it until the next time you receive 
information or look at the room.
