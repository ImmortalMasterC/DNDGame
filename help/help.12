	HOLD <object> [#]

Hold allows you to hold certain objects that are designated 
as "hold-able" items.  Things like torches, lanterns and wands 
are all hold-able.  Anything that you are holding, wearing or 
wielding cannot be stolen.  Certain things have to be held for 
them to have any use.   (For example, torches or lucky charms.)
