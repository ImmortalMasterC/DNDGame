	STUMBLE

Why did you stumble?  It's because you have low agility, and that
is either the result of carrying too much weight, too much gold, or 
wearing very heavy armor.  Every player starts out with a given 
amount of agility, and then it gets reduced as the player carries
items or gold.

As a class, thieves and assassins are give a bonus amount of agility 
as are females and members of the smaller races such as elves, gnomes, 
hobbits and others.  A player with high dexterity wil also have better
agility.  Also, if you carry a lucky object you will not stumble as
often.

You can cast either a levitate spell or a fly spell to mitigate the 
negative effects of too much weight or too much gold.  A super-strength 
spell will help.  If you carry more than $50,000 in gold you really 
ought to consider putting some of that heavy stuff in the bank.
