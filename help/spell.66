absolve
Clerics and monks who have reached a state of grace, being 
exceptionally good, have been given the power to absolve other 
player's sins.  When a eclesiastic casts an absolution spell on 
an evil player with a red aura, the evil one takes on a neutral 
gray aura and can then easily get back to being good.  One cannot 
absolve himself, however.

Alith, being the good and kind diety that he is, requires but a
modest 2000 pieces of gold as a tithe to his temple for this
service.  In addition, most clerics and monks find this is a way 
to supplement their income and may charge an additional amount 
for the service.  Alith encourages this, as it makes for a happy 
priesthood.
