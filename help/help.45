	BACKSTAB <monster/player> [#]

The backstab command is usable only by thieves and assassins, and 
allows them to do 2-3 times more damage than normal with sharp or 
thrusting weapons.  The thief or assassin must be hidden in order 
for a backstab to work, and if he or she fails, then they are 
considered vulnerable and will have to wait three times the normal 
amount of time before attacking again.  Backstab can only be used 
to initiate combat, not once the monster is already attacking you.
