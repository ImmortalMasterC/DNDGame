	BUY <object> [#]

If you are in a shoppe, you may purchase an item for sale with the 
buy command.  First use the LIST command to see what is for sale, 
and then buy it with this command.  Please note that when you use 
the buy command only the word that directly follows it is interpreted, 
so if you typed "buy leather boots," it would not matter what followed 
the word "leather."  This could cause you pain if there were several 
leather items for sale, because "buy leather" will buy you the first 
leather item on the list.  To avoid this problem, either use "buy 
boots" or "buy leather 2" where leather boots is the second leather 
item for sale.

Cost: 20	A leather hat
