	CRIPPLE <monster/player> [#]

This command allows fighters and assassins to cripple an opponent, 
knocking the foe to the floor for several seconds and inflicting a 
small amount of damage.  Each time a fighter or assassin succeeds, 
the monster becomes easier to hit.  
The attempt to cripple may be used at any time during combat.
