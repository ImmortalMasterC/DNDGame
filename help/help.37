	FLEE
	RUN

The flee command is a fool-proof way to escape a room when monsters 
have been attacking you and are really starting to hurt you.  With 
some monsters flee is unnecessary (because they do not attempt to 
block exits).  But other monsters block exits, and you may be forced 
to flee to save your life.  Any weapon which you had wielded is 
dropped in the room from which you fled.  Paladins lose a small 
amount of experience points for fleeing.
