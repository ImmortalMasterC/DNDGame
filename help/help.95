	JIMMY <container> [#] 

The JIMMY command can only be used by a thief.  It allows a thief to 
attempt to jimmy open a locked container.
The container can be either in your inventory or on the floor in the 
room.  If you have a container in your inventory of the same name as 
one on the floor, the one in your inventory will be used first.  The 
chance of success depends on the thief's level, dexterity and luck.

Snick.  You successfully jimmied the jewelry chest.

inventory, not the one on the floor.  If you want to jimmy the one
on the floor, you must specify jewelry chest 2.
