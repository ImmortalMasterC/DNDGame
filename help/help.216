    PAY <$gold> <monster> [#]

Darbonne has monsters such as doormen, gatekeepers and
porters which can be paid for their services.

As for gatekeepers and doormen, each one might have a
different fee to open a locked gate or door.  Talk to them
him and they will tell you the fee to unlock and open the 
portal.

Porters will carry your baggage for a fee of $5 for each 
place they follow you.  You can pay a porter up to $2500 
the first time, which would be good for 500 places.  Of 
course, you can pay any amount less than that also.  Give 
the porter all the items you want him to carry, then 
whisper "follow" to him.  If you want him to wait for you, 
simply whisper "wait" to him.  At any time you may pay him 
additional gold and he will follow you additional places.  
When you want your goods returned, whisper your password 
to him and he will drop his burden.  He will then guard 
your items from other players until you pick them up.  
It's important that you use the command, "get all" when 
you do, else the porter will not let you get more than the 
first item.

the Dungeonmaster advises you not to try to kill the porter.

NEVER "give" gold for a service.  You must "pay" for it.
