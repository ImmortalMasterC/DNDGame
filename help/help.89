	 RECHARGE  <object> [#]
	TRANSMUTE  <object> [#]
	     GLOW  <object> [#]

These commands are only available to an alchemist.  
No magic points are expended, and each command can only be done a 
limited number of times a day.

RECHARGE:  This skill allows an alchemist to transform gold into 
magical power.  The power obtained from the gold must immediately be 
put into a receptacle such as a wand.  The magic power obtained is 
used to charge any wand that is held during the process.  

TRANSMUTE:  Any object in the alchemist's possession except a magic 
item may be transmuted into gold.  The amount of gold obtained in 
this manner will never exceed the full value of the item, and will 
often be less, depending on the experience of the alchemist.

GLOW:  Certain weapons contain silver which can be made to glow with 
an enchantment.  These weapons can open slow healing wounds on the 
undead, making it difficult for them to recover from an attack.  Once 
this weapon has touched an undead, it loses that glow.  A level seven 
alchemist can restore that enchantment with the GLOW command.  There 
is a cost to the alchemist of one third the value of the weapon.
