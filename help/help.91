	RENEW  <object>  [#]

Some weapons are made of enchanted silver, which does particular
damage to the undead.  Because regular blacksmiths cannot repair
such weapons they must be renewed by a silversmith in a silver shop.  
For a hefty fee they are renewed to 90 percent of their original 
strength.  You can determine the fee before having the object 
renewed by using the COST command.  RENEW restores both the condition
of the weapon as well as the glow of its enchanted silver.
