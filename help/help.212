	SNATCH/GRAB <item> <player>

Thieves can snatch (grab) an item that is either wielded or held by 
another player, providing both the thief and his victim are chaotic. 

Success will depend on a variety of factors such as the relative
dexterity and levels of the two.  If the thief's dexterity and/or
level is higher than the victim, then the chance of success is higher.

There is a loss of a modest amount of experience points if the thief
fails to succesfully snatch an item from the other player.  The loss
is equal to four times the thief's level.

Unlike the steal command, the victim knows immediately when the thief
snatches an object.
