	STEALGOLD [from] <player/monster> [#]

Thieves may steal gold from monsters or other players.  If they 
are successful, the victim will not even know he or she had their 
gold taken.  However, if unsuccessful, the victim is warned.  
Monsters will attack if they become aware that someone is trying 
to take their gold.

CAUTION:  Just because you CAN steal, don't abuse it.  Its easy
          to become a real jerk and make enemies you don't need.
