	REPAIR <object> [#]

The repair command only works in repair shoppes and will allow you 
to repair an object that has been broken.  To find out how much the 
repair will cost, use the COST command first.  Once an item is 
repaired, it is as good as new.  But watch out, sometimes the repair 
smith completely shatters the object he's trying to repair.  He's 
not as good a smithy as he once was.
