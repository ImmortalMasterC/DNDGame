	DISTRACT <monster> [#]

Thieves may distract a monster that is guarding treasure on the 
floor, and if successful, the monster will not even know he or 
she has been distracted from their task.  Other players in the
room will not become aware of the succesful distraction, thus 
allowing the thief first chance at the treasure on the floor.

However, if unsuccessful, the monsters will attack the thief that
is making the effort and everyone in the room will know the thief
botched the job.
