	ATTACK <player/monster> [#]
	  KILL <player/monster> [#]

The attack command allows a player to fight a monster or player 
who is in the same room.  Once a monster is attacked, it will 
remember your face until it's dead, so don't make too many 
enemies at once.  
If you do not supply a numeric modifier to the monster's name and 
there are more than one of that monster in the room, then you will 
be assumed to be attacking the first such monster in the room.  As 
additional monsters are added to the room, they will be given larger 
identifying numbers, so you can assume that the numeric identifier 
you chose to begin with will not change.

IMPORTANT:  Combat in Darbonne is not like combat in many other MUDs 
where you type kill <monster> once and sit back and yawn.  You must 
continue to attack the monster you're fighting.
