Help on DM command:

	*clear [o|c] [index]

	This will clear a single object or creature from the database.
All data associated with the deleted creature or item is lost from the disk 
file.  This information may, in some cases, still exist in memory.  Thus, if 
you accidentally delete an object or creature from your database you may be 
able to recover it partially by using *monster [index] to load a monster from 
memory and then use *save to recover the information.

example:
:*clear o 10
Object #10 deleted.
:*clear c 10
Creature #10 deleted.
