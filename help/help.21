	TRACK

Track is a special ability that rangers have.  If a ranger 
is successful, he or she will discover the tracks of the last 
person to leave the room.  In other words, if a person had 
been in the room a day before and left the room by heading 
north, the ranger would be able to discover this fact with 
the track command.  This is extremely useful in getting out 
of maze-like dungeons or forests.  

NOTE:  There is also a track SPELL which can be cast.  
However, only rangers, druids and assassins can use it and
its purpose is to find and track a particular player.  When 
cast, the seeker will be transported to the target's room.
