	DISCARD <object> [#]
	
This command is used to discard an object from your inventory.
It is different from the DROP command in that the item does not
fall to the floor, but simply disappears completely.  The purpose 
of this command is to get rid of broken items that clutter the 
floor and slow the game.  You cannot discard a container unless
it is empty.

Remember though, any broken item is worth $5 in gold when you
drop it in a recycling room such as the rubbish pile in the park.

Suppose you have two black daggers in your inventory, and the 
second one is broken.  Perhaps it has been repaired and lost its
nice glow, so you don't want to repair it again.

Example:

: discard dagger 2
You discard a black dagger which disappears in a whisp of smoke.
