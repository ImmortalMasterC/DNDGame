	EQUIPMENT

Equipment shows you a list of the objects that you are currently 
wearing, wielding and holding.  Your armor class, AC, starts at
10 when you are not wearing anything, and decreases as you wear
more items.  A low AC makes it difficult for you to be hit during
a fight.  Some items lower your AC better than others.
