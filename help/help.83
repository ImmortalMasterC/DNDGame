	TOUCH

This function allows monks to kill non-undead creatures.
If they succeed, then the creature is either killed or 
harmed for approximately half of its hit points.  

A monk must be at least level 7 to use this skill, and a
neutral monk will not be able to use the touch of death
at all.   

Syntax:

touch <target>
