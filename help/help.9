	WEAR <object> [#]

The wear command allows you to wear items like body-armor, helmets, 
shields, gloves, sleeves, pants, etc.  If you are currently not 
wearing an item on that body location, then the command will succeed 
and your armor class will be adjusted accordingly.  You may enter 
"wear all" causing anything in your inventory that is wearable to 
be worn.  However, use caution with the "wear all" command, as the 
first thing in your inventory that can be worn will be placed on 
your body, and it may not be the item you want to wear.
NOTE:  A low armor class is desirable, as you are better 
protected from attacks.
