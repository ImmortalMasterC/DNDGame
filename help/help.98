	CLASSEMOTE <message>
	abbreviate as:  clem

This command broadcasts an emote message appended to the character's 
name, but only to members of the same class. 

example:  (If your character's name is Swifty and you are a thief.)
If you type:
clem  grabs a dragon by the tail!
Then all thief class players will see:
(Thief) ### Swifty grabs a dragon by the tail!
