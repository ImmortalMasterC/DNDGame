	VALUE <object> [#]
	 COST <object> [#]

The VALUE command only works in pawn shoppes, and is used to ask the 
shopkeeper how much money he will pay you for a particular item.  
However, be aware that your luck changes throughout the game, and 
luck can be a factor in how much you receive for an item you sell. 

Use the COST command n a repair shopt to find out how much the repair 
smith will charge you to fix either a piece of armor or a weapon.
