	*INVIS

	This is the DM invisibilty function.  Use it to toggle between 
invis and non-invis.  Note that if you logout as invis, when you log back 
in a braodcast message will not be printed.  Also, this type of invis is 
immune to the detect-invisibility spell.

example:
:*invis
Invisibility off.
