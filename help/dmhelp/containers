Notes concerning containers
Never use part of the name of a container in the name of the key
if the container can be fastened.
For example, there is a mahogony chest in the Mercator attic, and
when there was a mahognoy key, the command "use mah mah" always
caused a crash.

Containers are type 9 and also must have object flag 7 set.
This seems inconsistent, but that's the way it is.

When making a container, use shots to set how many item it may
hold.  0/7 means it is empty and will hold seven items.

Problem with fastened containers:  When the game resets after
being down, a container always comes back unfastened.  Someday
I will look at this problem.
