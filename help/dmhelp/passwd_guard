A monster can be created that will passivly guard
an exit until a secret password is given.

You must be sure to set Special = 1
and also set these monster flags...

	 1      Permanent monster
	22      Detect invisibility
	24      Monster can talk interactively
	25      Monster cannot be harmed
	39      Passive exit guard
	67      Cannot be bribed
	70      Quietly accepts a password

You must also create a talk file where the keyword
is the password needed to cause the creature to
allow entry.  Here's an example

	<password>
	Thank you, I bow to my master.  You may enter.


Also you must set the exit flag that is to be
guarded.

	19      Passive guarded exit
