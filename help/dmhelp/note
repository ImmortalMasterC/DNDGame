Sometimes you want to make notes to yourself, right?  
Well, just type *note and you get a note pad for just 
that purpose.

If you want to see your previous notes, type *note

You can delete all of the previous notes with the command:
	*note d

You can append to your old notes with the command:
	*note a <message>

When you are entering notes, a single period (.) on a line
terminates the notetaking.

See help *note
