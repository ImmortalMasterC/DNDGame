Create a Porter

A porter is a special monster in the game which will
carry a player's baggage if paid an appropiate amount
of gold.

To create a porter in the editor, you must set SPECIAL
equal to 2, and you must set flag number 68, which is
MPORTR, and flag number 8, MGUARD.  

Do not set any value for magic points.

====================================================

A player must do the following to make use of a porter:

pay <$amount> porter
	The fee is $5 for each place the porter will follow.  
	The maximum fee is $2500 for 500 places. 
	(The porter will accept more but will not go further
	without being paid additional money again.)
	After the porter has followed a number of places, 
	the player can pay more as often as needed.


whisper follow porter
	The porter will not follow until told to do so.

whisper wait porter
	The porter will stop following and wait.

whisper <player's password> porter
	The porter will drop all items carried and will
	guard it from being taken by other players.  The
	player who hired the porter must use the "get all"
	command to retrieve his items, else the porter 
	will not let him get anything but one item.
