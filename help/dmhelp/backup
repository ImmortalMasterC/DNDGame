Backup files
Every morning at 5:00 AM California time, there is an automatic backup
of all players.  Once each week, on Sunday, there is a weekly backup of
players.  Player files are located in /app/mud/darbonne/player and the
BACKUP directory is one level lower.  The WEEK directory is below that.

If there is a game crash and a player gets wiped out, he can be restored
from one of these two backups.  This is the procedure for doing it.
(You must have a login account on this machine to do this.)


1.	cd /app/mud/darbonne/player    # Go to the player directory

2.	ls -l <Player*>                # Don't forget to capitalize!
	  If the size of the file is 0, or does not exist, then you need
	  to copy the backup file to this directory.  Sometimes you will
	  find both a zero length file and a file with a tilde after it.
	  They may look like this:
	-rw-r-----   1 dm       users         0 Mar 21 05:00 Styx
	-rw-r-----   1 dm       users         995 Mar 21 05:00 Styx~
	  If the second one exists, you can just copy it to the first.
	  If it does not exist, that's when you need to copy the backup
	  file to the current file.

3	This is the copy command.
3a.	cp Styx~ Styx                  # Do this if you have a tilde file.
3b.	cp BACKUP/Styx .               # This will make a copy of the backup.
	  If the backup does not exist, or is zero length also, then the 
	  damage was done just prior to the automatic backup and the bad
	  file was put into BACKUP.  If that happens, get the backup file
	  from WEEK.  It will be a few days old, but it will exist.
3c.	cp BACKUP/WEEK/Styx .          # that period is important!

4.	After the repair is made, be sure you call the editor and use it
	to discover the player's password.  Then try to login that player.
	Sometimes the player file is so corrupted it will crash the game
	and needs to be removed from the database.  To remove a player file:

4a.	rm <Player>                   # this is the remove command.
