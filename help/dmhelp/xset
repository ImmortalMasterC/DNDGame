SETTING EXIT PARAMETERS:

	*set x <name1> <room #> <name2>
	
Example:		*set x door 1225 out
  This will set an exit in the current room called door which will link 
  to room 1225.  In room 1225, an exit called out will link back to the 
  current room.  If a period is used for name2, then the exits in both 
  rooms are given the same name.
  If name1 is included in the group below, then it can be abreviated, and 
  name2 can be automatically set by using a period for name2.

north          northwest          northeast          west
south          southwest          southeast          east
up             down               trap               out
left           right              forward

Example:		 *set x ne 1225 .
  This will set the exit in the current room as northeast, and will link 
  to room 1225.  The exit in room 1225 will be set to southwest, which is
  the opposite direction, and will link back to the current room.

If you wish to delete an exit, set it to room 0.

	*set x nrth 0

MULTI-WORD EXIT NAMES:
  Exits can have more than one word names, but they must be entered with 
  an underscore between the words.

Example:		*set x great_oaken_door 1225 out

  However, do not use this for name2.  The exit will retain the underscore.
  Instead, go to the new room and set the exit back to the first room.

FLAGS, MISC AND KEYS:
  Flags and misc may be set using this syntax:  (See the list of exit flags.)

	*set xf <exit> f#

	*set xm <exit> misc#

And keys are set using this syntax:  

	*set xk <exit>  key#

Note:  The key number is not the object number.  It is the ndice number.

Example:		 *set xk 1225 25

  This sets the key to lock/unlock the exit to room 1225 with a key with
  25d0 as its code.
