A monster can be used as a sentinel for a doorway
which he will guard until given a password.

The monster must have SPECIAL = 1 and the following 
flags should be set:
Flag  1	   Permanent
     22    Detects Invisibility
     24    Talks
     25    Unkillable
     39    Passive Guard
     67    Cannot be bribed
     70    Accepts Password

The room's guarded doorway must have this flag set:
Flag 19    Guarded exit

The room must also have the sentry placed as a
permanent monster with 0 time of return. 

A talk file has to be created in the directory objmon/talk
where the action word is the password.  A talk response
is not necessary, but may be used.
NOTE:  More than one action word may be used so as to
to create a multiple password protected doorway.
The talk file syntax is:
<password>
<text response>

When the monster is given the password, it leaves and
the doorway is left unguarded.  The monster returns as
soon as the room is clear. 

Do not add any talk sequences to the talk file, else any
active keyword will cause the monster to leave his post.
(This could be used as a feature where any keyword in the
talk file would cause the guard to leave.  It doesn't have
to be the player's password.)
