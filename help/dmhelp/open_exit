Want to move a rock to reveal a concealed entrance?

Make a small rock and set the permanent flag.  Place it in the room where
the exit is located.  Suppose this is the room:

Trail's End
You have reached the end of the trail.  A large rock blocks your way to
the north.  South of you is a dark jungle.  There's a smaller rock jutting
from the larger one, and it looks like you could move it.  An inscription
written in magic letters appears and says, "push me."
Obvious exits:  south
You see a small rock.

Make another exit called "hole in the rock", and set the no-print flag.
This is the second exit.

Now edit the small rock in the editor:
	Set shots to 0/0
	Place a zero in the output string:  0
	Since the "hole in the rock" is the second exit, make the dice plus = 2
	(note:  dice plus number == exit number)
	Set Special to 2

You also must set the XNPRNT flag and the XNOSEE flag.  XNPRNT means the
exit does not print, but could be used anyway.  To keep it from being usable,
set the no-see flag as well.
