THE MOBILE PUSH-BUTTON

The traditional means for making a combination lock call for 
creating one or more buttons with the following properties:
Set hitroll to  0DX + Y 
(where X = the value of that button and Y = the exit number to 
be targeted with the push button if the sequence is successful).
Additionally, the button is to be set as type: 13 and special: 2
Finally, the output value is to be a numeric code representing 
the correct order in which buttons are to be pressed.

For example, there is a place in Darbonne where the CHIMNEY can
be pushed and it opens up a secret hole:
set hitroll to: 0d1 + 2 , output =1, type = 13, special = 2
In the room with the chimney, There is only ONE obvious exit. 
The second exit is the hole to be opened, and it is hidden.
(corresponding with the +2 on the hitroll).

The concept of the pushbutton can be expanded to include MOBILE
pushbuttons.  Take the case of the bucanneer's spade which is 
item No. 734.  The bucaneer's spade is set as a button, with the 
hitroll 0d1 +10 .  The +10 is the element which allows it to be 
mobile, because very few rooms in mordor have more than six exits, 
and this spade will only open exit #10.
Creatively, this now means we have a tool which can open up areas 
in which it is sensible to use it.

Since a spade is in fact a shovel, we can create areas in which 
it makes sense to have a shovel, such as a buried treasure room, 
or an area in the snow to be excavated.  Such rooms would need to 
have "filler" exits, so that a valid tenth exit can be added, 
targeted by the mobile button.  

Example
Room 4916: Island of Anglessey:
Obvious exits: west, south
No-print exits: soa, sob, soc, sod, soe, sof, sog, sand_stairs
The sandstairs exit is #10, and has flags 3-7 so the exit cannot 
be picked.  The exits before it point to the same room as does 
the "south" exit.

Voila, we have a mobile pushbutton!
