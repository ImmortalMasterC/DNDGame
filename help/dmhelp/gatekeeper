A monster can be made into a gatekeeper or doorman
by setting flag 76.  The gatekeeper will open a 
door or gate if paid his fee.

When you create a gatekeeper, the amount of the fee is 
the same as the amount you set as the monster's gold.

The "fixed amount of gold", flag 26, should be set, as 
well flag 67, "Cannot be bribed".

The exit should have flags 3,4,5,6,7 and 63 set.
