Message From an Object

All objects can be given an output string of text that
is seen when the object is used or held.  Occasionally
you might want that output string to serve perhaps as
a quest clue, and you only want it to be displayed when
the player is in a certain room and holds the object.  
Let's call the room the convergence room.  It might also 
be used as a maze guide, telling the direction to go only 
when it is held in the convergence room.

This is what you need to do:

OBJECT
Create an object with the desired output string.
Set the object special = 5.
Set wear to 17, which is hold.
Set the shots.  When the object has been used in the
convergence room equal to the number of shots, it
disintegrates to gray dust.  Of course, you could set
the flag for never used up (flag 52) if you don't want 
a limited number of uses.  


ROOM
You will need two rooms with consective room numbers.
The higher numbered room is a storage room where you
must place a permanent copy of the object you have
created.  

Be sure to set flags 1 and 10, drop the object on the 
floor, and type *perm
You should get a message that says, done.

Also, be sure players cannot teleport to this room.
Set room flags:
	13 (cannot teleport)
	34 (cannot login)
and	39 (cannot use as a home room)

The lowered number room is the convergence room where
you want the player to be when he holds the object.  
The only thing you need to do here is set the room special 
to 5.

*set r spec 5
