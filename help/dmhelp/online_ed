	This Document Will Help You Use The On-line Room Editor.

For tutorial purposes, let's assume you wish to create a new room while
on-line in the game.  If you need to know what room numbers are already 
used, you can use the star command for listing rooms.

*list r

Unfortunately, this isn't a very good way to do it, since the entire 
list of rooms will scroll by and all you will see is the last screen.
Better to do it a little at a time by specifying the range.  Suppose
you want to see what rooms are available between room number 1100 and
1300...  do this:

*list r -r1600:1700


Suppose you see there are a block of unused room starting at room 1200.
Now add the new room and then teleport to it.

*add r 1200
*t 1200

You are are in a blank room with no name or description.  
There are no exits.  This command will create a name for the room. 

*name Wiley's Bar and Grill

You have to create a short description for it.  This is best if it fits 
on a single line.  You could use either the *append or *prepend command,
because nothing has yet been written, but the -s specifies the short 
description and is the best way with a new room. 

*app -s You are in Wiley Coyote's Bar and Grill, a run-down gin mill.


Next, you write the long description for the room.  Since this is a line-
editor, each line must start with the *app command.

*app Years ago Wiley gave up trying to catch the roadrunner and
*app retired to this little spot in the desert.  As you look
*app around you see most of the furniture came from a used
*app furniture business.  Under the table is a box marked with
*app three large X's.  In smaller letters it says ACME DYNAMITE.

Be sure to save the room to the database with the save command.

*sav

Suppose you want to do some editing of your text...
to replace the word "spot" with the word "oasis", do this:

*rep spot oasis

If you want to delete the word ACME, do this: 

*del ACME 	Note:  Be sure to include a space after the word.

Or, if you want to delete a phrase, use the -P option:

*del -P Under the table 

Again, if you don't want a extra space in your text, be sure to 
include a trailing space in the text you delete.

When a word such as "the" occurs more than once in the text, and you 
want to edit perhaps the third occurance of it, maybe changing it to
the word "those," be sure to specify the number. 

*rep  the 3 those

And, if you would like to take out all of the text from a certain point 
to the end of the entire description, you can use this command:

*del -E <enough of the text to be specific.>

Sometimes you have already created a room and have the text, and then
decide to edit it.  There is a command to allow you to add text at the
end of the last line.  For example, you might add this sentence to a short
last line:  "The door has blood on it."

*app -n The door has blood on it.

Sometimes this added sentence is placed at the end of the last word, with
no space between them.  That's a bug, but you can just edit the line and
put in the space you need.  

You can delete the entire short description or the entire long description.

*del -S
*del -L

There is no command to delete the name, but you can simply use the *name
command again to change it.

Be sure to use the *save command to save your changes.  If you decide you
don't want to save the changes you have just made, and want the old text
back, (and haven't done the *sav command yet.)  just type:  

*reload
