	How to Add a Social Command

This describes how to add a social command to the Mordor code.
As an example, this is how the 'salute' command was added.

In global.c you will find a list of all the social commands.  They
look like this:
	{ "dance", 100, action },

Insert a similar line with your new command to add it to the list.
	{ "salute", 100, action },

Now open the file action.c and see the syntax for each action command.
Note that some social actions do not need a target, but that others do.
(You can dance by yourself, but you need someone to goose.)  The action
we are adding, salute, could be either.  Let's require a target.

At the end of the file, add these lines:
 
	else if(!strcmp(cmdlist[cmdno].cmdstr, "salute")) {
		if(crt_ptr) {
			OUT4("You salute %m.\n", 
			     "%M stands and salutes you.\n",
			     "%M stands and salutes %m.");
		}
		else
			print(fd, "salute whom?\n");
	}

Note the OUT4 line...  The code provides different OUT commands depending
on the action taken.  The best way to see which OUT command to use is to
look at the different social actions for examples.
Suppose a player named Jojo types:  salute bozo

For this particular OUT4 command, the %m format is for the target, which is
bozo, and the %M is for the player doing the salute, who is Jojo.  
The OUT4 command takes care of printing a message to Jojo, a message to Bozo,
and to the room in general.

The last thing you have to do is add the new command to the help file.
Change to the help directory and open the help.100 file.  You will find
a list of all social commands possible.  Insert the word salute.

You're done.  Easy, wasn't it?
