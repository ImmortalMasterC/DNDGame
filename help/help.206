	GAZE <exit>
	
This talent can only be used by Rangers, Druids and Mages.
It allows you to "see" into the next room without actually entering
that room.  However, it does not work for all rooms.  In general, it
will not work if the exit has more than a single word for its name,
nor will it work for any but the first when two exits have the same name.
 
If you are a Ranger or a Druid, and above level four, this is an
ability that can be used at any time.  If you are a Mage, you do not 
need to cast it, but it will cost you 10 MP anytime you use it.

Example:

: gaze north

You are looking at the north exit.

You would see the complete description of the room immediately north
and any players in it.  But you would not see the exits from that room, 
nor any monsters in it.
