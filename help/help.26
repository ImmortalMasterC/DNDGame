	HIDE [<object> [#]]

The hide command allows you to hide yourself or objects that 
are in the room.  If you type hide by itself, you will attempt 
to hide in the shadows to prevent other players or monsters 
from seeing you in the room.  You can also attempt to hide any 
object that is sitting on the room's floor, and if you are 
successful the object will not be visible to anyone who does 
not search for it.  Rangers, thieves and assassins hide best.

On the floor you see: a small knife, a bag.
