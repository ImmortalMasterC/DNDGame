	NEWSPAPER

This command allows you to read the News of the Day, which is sort
of a newspaper for the citizens of Darbonne.  The news is not on a
regular schedule, and is not always accurate, but it will have juicy
tidbits of gossip and interesting notes concerning Mordor.  There is
also an advertising section where you may place an ad for such things
as offers of help or items for sale.  However, there is a small fee 
for this service.  The cost is $10 per word.  Send mudmail to the
Dungeonmaster with the exact wording of your ad, and it will run for 
at least three days.
