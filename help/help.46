	TRAIN

The train command allows a character to go up a level after achieving 
a sufficient amount of experience.  Each class has its own training 
location, and if you are unsure if a place is your particular site, 
it won't hurt to type TRAIN in several rooms until you find it.  
Usually, the training room is related in some logical way to your 
character's class.  The amount of experience required to go from 
level one to level 2 is 512 experience.  From that point on the 
amount required continues to double, i.e. 1024 XP for level three, 
2048 XP for level four, etc.  
The experience required after level 10 is less than double.

Gold is also required to train.  The amount of gold required is half 
the amount of experience required.  When you gain a level, you gain 
additional hit points and magic points, and one of the 5 stats is 
increased.
