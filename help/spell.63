spell.63

Conjure:
This is a talent for chaotic mages, and does not need to be learned.
Casting this spell brings forth a protective wraith which will protect
the mage calling it from chaotic players.  A protector can only be
summoned three times each day.  Depending on the mage's level, either
a level 10 shade will be summoned, or a level 15 specter, or a level
20 phantom.  The protective wraith is immediately aggressive toward
the specified target, providing the target is also chaotic.  If no
target is specified, then the wraith is aggressive to everyone, even
the mage who summoned it.

However, the wraith is rather benign in that no experience points are
lost when it kills a player and no experience points are gained for
killing it.  The killed player will drop a wielded weapon and find
himself in Limbo.  (This might change in the future.)
