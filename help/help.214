	FIX <object1> [#] <object2> [#]

Some objects are repair tools and can be used to fix other objects.
The degree to which an object is repaired depends to some extent
on the dexterity of the player, but it will never be repaired as
well as a blacksmith can do the job.  You cannot fix containers,
scrolls or other repair tools.  Also, because it takes a lot of 
effort to use repair tools, you must have at least 20 HP.

There is a high probability that you will shatter both the repair 
tool and the item you want to fix if your luck is bad or if your 
piety is low.

HP cost: 20      Syntax: fix helmet with hammer

NOTE:  There is an alternate method that may be used:
