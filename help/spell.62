spell.62

hex:
This spell allows the caster to bring bad luck to another player 
or creature.  A player or creature under a hex spell not only 
suffers very bad luck, but also has a difficult time hitting an 
enemy during an attack.

Only an alchemist, bard, druid, mage or monk understands how to 
cast this particular spell.

The spell fails if the targeted player is holding a lucky charm. 
Also, the hex spell can be removed by holding a lucky charm after 
the spell has been cast.
