	LOSE <player>
	NOFOLLOW <player>

Either command can be used with or without a <player>
The command allows you to "lose" a person that is following you,
effectively kicking him or her out of your group.  Use this command 
if there is someone following you that you would prefer not to have 
following you.  If you do not want anyone to follow you, there is a
SET command you can use.  For more information, type:  help set
If you do not specify a target you can also use the LOSE command to
stop following another player.
Also see this command: FOLLOW
