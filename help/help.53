	SENDMAIL
	READMAIL
	DELETEMAIL

These commands only work in a designated post office, and allow you to 
send letters to other players that play the game.  To send a letter
to another player, you use the SENDMAIL command.  To read your mail,
use the READMAIL command.  And to delete your mail once you've read it
use the DELETEMAIL command.  The text editor for the sendmail command is
very primitive and does not have word wrap, so do not make lines longer
than 80 characters in length.  To end a letter, hit the Enter key twice.
