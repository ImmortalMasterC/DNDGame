Help on Social Commands:

	These commands enable you to role-play much more effectively.  
Please be careful using some of them, as a few are offensive.  
(But of course, sometimes you mean to be offensive.)
	For social commands that do not appear on this list you may use the 
EMOTE command.  This will allow you to customize your character's behavior.
Also, be sure to see the DESCRIPTION command that allows you to make a
descriptive appearance of your character.
