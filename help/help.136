	*NOTEPAD [d|a]

	This allows you to read, append, and delete the DM notepad.  With no 
flag, it will print out the notepad.  The d flag clears the notepad, and
the a flag allows appending to the notepad.  A single period (.) on a line 
by itself will terminate the appending of text.

example:
:*notepad
            === DM Notepad ===

Green Slime needs to be added to rm903

:*notepad a
DM notepad:
->fixed exit north in rm402
->.

:*notepad d
