	FOLLOW <player>

The follow command will allow you to follow another player
as he/she moves from place to place.  When another player 
is in the same room as you, you can "follow" him or her.  
Then whenever that player moves in a given direction, you 
will automatically follow.  This is extremely useful for 
adventuring in groups.
