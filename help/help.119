	*add [r|c|o] [#]

    This creates a new room in the database, or a new creature or object 
for editing.  A number must be specified when creating a new room, but
objects will arrive in your inventory, and creatures will be loaded into
the room.

    NOTE: Rooms are automatically added to the database, whereas creatures
and objects must be saved after completion using the *save command. 

example:
:*add r 4123
Room #4123 created

:*add c
A clay form just arrived.
Creature created. 

:*add o
Generic item added to your inventory.
