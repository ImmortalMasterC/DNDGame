	*OBJSAVE <object> <index number>

	You can save an object to the database with this command. 
Be sure to list the objects to find the last index number, else you may
overwrite an existing object.

	*SAVE c <name> <creature>

	This will allow you to save a creature to the database.  See the
warning above.

Caretakers do not have the ability to use these two commands, but they
can make an object or creature and then give it to the DM so that it
may be saved.
