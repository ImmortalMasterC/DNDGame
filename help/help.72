	PLEDGE [to] <monster>

Pledge allows you to join the forces of either Prince Ragnar or 
Prince Rutger, warring princes in the Land of Mordor.  When you 
join, you get many benefits.  You may kill players who are pledged 
to the opposing prince and gain experience, even if they are lawful.  
If you kill someone in your own group, you will both lose experience.  
The amount of experience gained or lost is dependent on the level of 
the characters involved.  You may RESCIND your pledge at any time, 
but there is a cost.
