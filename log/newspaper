Although the Darbonne MUD does not have a policy against using robot
players, the DungeonMaster consides rthem fair game for their pleasure.  
If you leave a character unattended, you almost certainly will not like 
the results when you return.  DO NOT COMPLAIN about what happens.  
A complaint will result in punishment to the complainer!

The House of Delights in Quickhand has hired a doorman to keep out the 
riff-raff.  If you want to enter, you will have to pay him $20.

DISPEL
After a very long time, this spell now works as intended.  It's actually
an anti-spell and is very dangerous in that it completely nullifies all 
other spells you might currently be under.  If you cast a dispel on yourself 
or another player it will cancel any active spell such as light, reflect, 
bless, etc.  If you are chaotic and are either attacked or about to attack, 
this might help you.  See: help dispel

SHADOW MAGIC TEMPLE
Assassins will need to explore the temple if they hope to advance to a
higher level.  

TRUXTON ARENA
Beware the soldiers.  Not all of them are easy to kill.  Some remain
as of old, but a few are much stronger.  Best you look at them before
you decide to attack.

PORTER
A porter is someone who will carry your baggage for a fee.  Porters
are available in the south of Quickhand.

POWER LEVELING
Each time you go to train for a new level you must go to a new room.
Many times you will be asked to perform a quest and perhaps bring back
a particular item, which you might trade to the keeper in the training
location.  Other times your knowledge of far away places might allow you
to know the answer to a question which will allow you into the training
area.  Because these are part of the game's goals to further your fun,
they should not be bypassed.  Some players have been accumulating excess
experience points and then training several times in one place to avoid
exploring or finding the quest item.  Well, the code has been changed.
You can't do that anymore.  


YOU MIGHT STUMBLE
If you are carrying a large inventory or a lot of weighty armor, you
might find it affects your agility.  Also, gold weighs a lot, too.
It might be a wise idea to put your gold in the bank if you have more
than $50,000 (except barbarians) and it would definitely be a good idea
to stop carrying so much stuff.  Find a place to stash those ill-gotten
goods!  The DM staff can make you a nice home with storage chests for
a small (cough) fee.  Type:  help stumble

A NEW FEATURE  
There is a class of objects that can be used to repair broken objects 
without the need to find a blacksmith shop.  For example, an enchanted 
hammer could be used to fix some broken armor you might have a special 
fondness for, and at no cost.  Of course, you probably cannot do as good 
a job as the blacksmith, and the chance of breaking it completely is 
always present.  Try: help fix
