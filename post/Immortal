Yeah, there was a bad crash.  It might take me awhile, and I can't
give you back everything, but I can get you back to level 19
Give me some time.

Since the database was destroyed, the best I can do for
you is advance you a level higher than you were.
I also gave you a lot of gold, so I hope this is
enough compensation for you.  I can't do much 
more, but learning the spells again should be easy
for you.
