Mail from Styx (Wed Apr 16 21:18:10 2014):

if you are ready to level and need the clump of wax
then I may have to advance you manually, and that
means we both have to be logged on at the same time.
Dunno if we can manage that, but send me a real email
of the times you plan to be on and if I can be here
we will do it.  My real email:  styx@styx.darbonne.com
