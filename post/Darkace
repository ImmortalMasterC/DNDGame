Mail from Styx (Wed Apr 16 21:14:25 2014):

Hello -
I received only part of the mudmail you sent because
you did not do it properly.  At the end of the line
you must hit the Return or Enter key...  This mail
feature is not a Word Processor and does not automatically
do word-wrap.  So most of your message after the first line
was lost.  Want to try again?
