GSTAT COMMAND:

The gstat command produces various statistical information about all
the characters in mordor.  In addition, gstat can list all the 
mordor characters that exceed a given amount of gold, play time,
or level.

Syntax:
        gstat [-glts #] [-d] [-P <players ...>]

The flags can appear in any order except for the '-P' which must be 
the last flag in the command arguement list.  Also each flag must 
appear separately.   i.e. -gl 10 needs to be -g 10 -l 10
Also, due to the amount of data output, the static breakdown will not be
listed if the -d, -g, -l or -t flags are used.

    -d    The '-d' flag will list all the players that are either
          a DM, a caretaker or None.

    -g #  The '-g' flag will list all players with '#' or more
          gold.

    -l #  The '-l' flag will list all players that are '#'+
          level. 

          breakdown on players '#'+ level.  This is intended to allow
          for a more accurate statical breakdown.  Often times
          players create a 'one time' character which can skew
          the true static brekadown of the game..

    -t #  The '-t flag will list all players that have a play
          time greater than '#' seconds..

    -P <players...> The '-P' tells gstat to run gstat only on the 
          player's names specified after the '-P'.  If the '-P
          is not present, gstat will use all the characters in
          the players directory.  Note: the player's names following
          '-P' still must be in the player/ directory. The '-P'
          was intended as a means to limit gstat static domain.

Examples:
      gstat -l 10
         -- list all the players that are 10+ level.

      gstat -d -P P1 P2 P3
         -- list all the DMs in the player list P1, P2, P3

      gstat -s 2
         -- only preform the statical breakdown on players that
            are 2nd or higher level.el.

Other notes:

Class / Level Breakdown:
    The number following the Class number tells the total 
    number of players of that class.  The two lines of numbers
    represents the number of players of the given class at
    at each level.  The first line of numbers corresponds to 
    1st to 13th level , the second line of numbers corresponds to
    14th to 26th level, where 26 slot is for all players that are
    26+ level..

    Due to the amount of output from gstat, and the length of time to
    search all the players, it might be easier to redirect gstat 
    output to a file: gstat > gstat_file.
Use italk instead of telnet because telnet is an ugly
way to connect to anything, 

italk localhost 4040
or on tesla 
italk m

If you insist on TELNET, then use telnet localhost 4040

            -m#       rooms with monster 

PLIST COMMAND:

    The plist commands provides a simply way to list a given player's
class, level, password, and inventory without having to use the editor
or actually log the player in.  

syntax: 
    plist [[-inp] [-l #]] <players>

    -n    The '-n' tells plist to only list the name of the player.
          The '-n' flag is intented to be used with the '-l #' 
          flag to allow the output list of players to be piped
          or redirected into another command.

    -i    The '-i' flag requires plist to list all the objects in the
          player inventory, including items in containers.  The
          output format is a bit rough, so some line wrap around
          may occur.  NOTE:  It is not wise to type "plist -i *" in
          the player directory due to the massive amount of data
          that would be produced.

    -p    The '-p' requires plist to display the player password.

    -l #  The '-l #' requires plist to list all players equal to the 
          given level #.


Examples:
    plist -p Foo Bar
      -- this will list the class, level, race and password for 
         Foo and Bar.

    plist -l 1 Player1 ... Player10
      -- this will list all the players that are level 1 in the list
         of players Player1 to Player10.

    plist -i Fubar
      --this will list the class, race, level  and inventory
        for the player Fubar.


PSEARCH COMMAND:

   The psearch command searchs all the characters in the mordor/player
directory for a specified item.  Psearch will search a characters entire 
inventory including the contents of containers.  Psearch will list a player's
name, the total number of specified object in the player's possession,
and the number of the specified objects that are in containers.
Psearch also has the option to list any weapon that does more than
a specified amount of damage, or armor that exceeds a given armor
rating.

syntax:
    psearch <[object #] [-adnsv #] [-N <name>]> [-P <players>]


    If the first argument for psearch is a number, then psearch 
will search for the object corresponding to that number.  The item
number does not have to be given if any of the other flags are set.
The flags may appear in any order.


    -a #   The '-a' will list all objects on players that have
           an armor rating equal or greater to '#'.

    -d #   The '-d' will list all objects on players that do
           a maxium damage equal or greater than '#'.  This is
           based on ndice*sdice + pdice.

    -n #   The '-n' flag specifies the object number to search for.
           This flag is redundant if the object number has already 
           been specified as the first argument of psearch.

    -s #   The '-s' will list all players that know the spell 
           which corresponds to '#'. The first spell starts at 0.

    -v #   The '-v' will list all objects on players with value
           exceeding '#'.

    -N <name> Requires psearch to use the name following the -N as
           the name of the object to search for.  The given name
           has to perfectly match the object name in ordor for the object
           to be listed.  In cases where the object name is more than
           one word or contains single quotes, the entire name needs
           to be double quoted.   i.e. psearch -N "dragon's blade"

   -P <players> Normally psearch will search all the players in
           the mordor/player/ directory. The '-P' flag requires psearch
           to only search the following list of players.  Note:  the
           list of players still must exist in mordor/player/. The '-P'
           allows a way to limit psearch's search domain.

Examples:
    psearch 212
     --this will list all the players that have object 212 
       (assassin daggers)

    psearch -d 20
     --this will search and list all the players and objects that
       can do 20+ damage. 

    psearch -N "small knife" -P P1 P2 P3
     -- this will search all the given players (P1, P2, P3) that
        have objects with the name of small knife. 


Errors:
     If a player cannot be loaded, the user will be notifed of a
     player load error.or.


startup is a shell auto startup / running program for mordor.  This
should only be executed as mordor user.

TDEL COMMAND:

   The tdel command will list or delete all files that have not been 
modified in a specified number of days.  The number of days is
specified by the first command arguemnt of tdel.  Note: the number
of days can be a floating number (i.e. 2.2, 60.5, etc).

syntax:
    tdel <# of days> [-d] [-F <files ..>]

    -d  The '-d' flag requires tdel to delete all files that are
        X or more days old, where X is the specified number of days.

    -F  <files...> The '-F' requires tdel to list/delete the specified 
        files after the '-F' flag. If '-F' is not set, tdel will
        list / delete the files in the specifed directory (the
        path is hard coded and currently set to mordor/player/).
        Note: '-F' must appear as the last command flag, since
        all arguements following '-F' are assumed to be file names.
        The files are also assumed to in the current work directory,
        or a relative path to the current working directory
        The files are also assumed to in the current work directory,
        or a relative path to the current working directory.


Examples:
    tdel 10
     -- tdel will LIST all files in the player/ that have not been
        modified in the last 10 days.

    tdel 10 -d
     -- tdel will DELETE all files in the player/ that have not been
        modified in the last 10 days.

    tdel 25 -d -F F1 F2 F3
      -- tdel will delete any of files following  the -F flag (F1,F2,F3)
         that has not been  modified in the last 25 days.

    If the monster is presented with a certain item (players use
    the trade command), the monster will give an item to the player.
    This is useful in making interactive monster / player quests.
    As of now, the 10 possible carried items represents the traded item/
    reward.  The first 5 of the monster carried items represent a needed
    item by the monster.  In return for one of these items the monster
    will give the player the object located in the carried item slot
    (needed item + 5).  For example, a player gives a monster an item
    described in carried item slot 1, the monster will return

    Once the monster is killed, the text in the monster's death 
    description will be displayed to everyone in the room where
    the monster's death occured. The location of the death scene file
    is in ddesc/ (currently mordor/objmon/ddesc/).  The name of the 
    file is the monster's name "_" monster level. All blank spaces
    in the name need to be replaced with '_' (i.e. Barney_the_dinosaur_20).
    The monster with the death scene must also be a permanent monster.

This is how you make a monster, including all kinds 
of neato advice and recomendations.
mk_monster
Interactive talk

    Interactive talk allows a monster and a player to interactively
talk.  When a player asks a monster about a "key" question, the monster 
will respond with a specified response.  In addition, a monster can perform
various actions (attack, social command, or cast a spell) whenever asked 
about a key word.  The interactive talk file is located in:
/usr/games/mordor/objmon/talk. 
Generally the name of the file is the name of the monster-level.
The format to use the interactive talk file is:
<key word line> [action phrase]
<response line>

    The maximum size of the key word line is 80 characters while the response
line can be up to 1024 characters (including carriage return and null 
character).  Note: a hard return will denote the end of a line, so 
return should only be entered at the end of "key word line" and
the  "response line".  

    The <key word> is defined by a single word (no spaces).  The 
parameters for the action phrase are based on the type of the
command.  A monster can perform the following actions:

<key word> ATTACK
    The monster will attack the player who asks the monster about the 
given key word.  The word ATTACK must appear in all capitals.

<key word> ACTION type PLAYER
    The monster will perform the social action defined by type when the
key word is spoken.  The type parameter can be any of the normal social
commands.  If the social command is followed by the word PLAYER, the 
social action will be performed on the player who spoke the key word.  
Otherwise the social command will be interpreted as general (wave vs 
wave happy).  Note the words ACTION and PLAYER must appear in all capitals.

<key word> CAST <spell>
    The monster will cast the given spell on the player who
spoke the key word.  The monster must have sufficient mp, and belong

to successfully cast the spell.

<key word> GIVE <item #>
    The monster will give a specified object to the player who asked the 
key word.  Object may be a quest item, in which case the player will only
be able to receive one of the item.  Also, if a player is weighted down,
and unable to hold the object, the monster will not give the object. 
Be careful with the value of the objects being given away since it might 
provide a loop hole for making money.

examples:

die ATTACK
response.
    If a player asks a monster about "die", the monster will give
the response and then attack the player.

bye ACTION wave

	How to Create a Combination Lock

Combination locks appear in the game as buttons that must be pushed in a
particular sequence.  Usually they are color-coded, but you can give them
any description you please.  The editor is used to make them as objects.

First, make as many buttons as you desire with each one being a separate
object.  For example, you might make four buttons, black, red, white and blue.
Each button is TYPE 13, and SPECIAL 2.

Now, assume we want the black button to be number zero, (reset) and the
red button to be number one, the white number 2, and the blue one number
three.

A combination of 132 would require the sequence red, blue, white be pushed.
Of course, you can require that a button be pushed more than once if you
want a longer combination..

In the output string for each object, put the combination, preceded by a
zero.  Example:  0132322
The first zero is the reset, and each number is a colored button.

Makes the shots equal to 0/0.

In order to identify the Reset button as different from the others,
make it:
	1d0 Plus 2.

Each of the other buttons are:
	0d1 Plus 2
	0d2 Plus 2 
	0d3 plus 2

Where the numbers following the 'd' indicate the combination number for 
that object.

Set the following flags:  1 and 18. 
Flag 1 is to make the button permanent.
Flag 18 is the no-take property.

When you create the room this lock goes in, be sure to put the buttons as
permanent objects.  Also, be sure to set the exits flags 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

	How to Create a Shop

A shop must always have a storage room associated with it.  The storage
room must be the next sequential room number.  The storage room is where
items are stored that will appear on the list in the shop.  Be sure to set
the room flag 13 in the storage room so that players cannot teleport there.

After the shop and storage room have been created, go to the storage room
and create one each of the items you want to appear in the shop's list.
Then, set both flags 9 and 10 for the item(s) and drop them on the floor.
And last, you must use the DM command *perm to make the items permanent.
NOTE:  If the game is being heavily used you may have to type *perm many
times.  You will get either a "failed" or "done" message each time.  Keep
trying until the "done" message appears.


EXAMPLE

You decide to make a room that sells only rings.

1.	Create a new room with your description.
	Set the shop flag.  flag 1.

2.	Create a storage room, exactly one room number higher.
	Set the no teleport flag.  flag 13.

3.	Log in to the game and go to the storage room.

4.	Use the DM command *c <ring number> to put a ring in your inventory.
	Set the two permanent flags.  flag 9 and flag 10.
	Use the DM command *set o ring f #

5.	At this point, you can change the value of the ring to be different
	than that set in the editor.  What ever you change it to will be the
	price set by the shop.
	Use the DM command *set o ring v <$$$>

6.	Drop the ring in the storage room.
	Use the DM command *perm.  (Continue until you get the "done" message.)

7.	Congratulations!  Now type list in the shop to check your handiwork.
