		HOW TO MAKE A COMBINATION LOCK

An easy way to create a combination lock is to have the player push
a series of buttons in the correct order.  Any single button can be
pushed more than once.
Generally, buttons are colored and the black button is the RESET button.
When you create them in the editor, they are TYPE 13 and SPECIAL 2.
Here's an example:

Let's make a red, white and blue button to use for a combination lock. 
We will also need a black button for the Reset.

Set the shots to 0/0

Set the dice differently for each button:

	red     0d1 + 2
	blue    0d2 + 2
	white   0d3 + 2

The reset button is different.  Set the dice for the reset like this:

	black	1d0 + 2

In the output string of each button, put the combination... 
which is the order you want the buttons to be pushed.  Like this:

	0122132

Now, the player must push the buttons in this order:

	black red blue blue red white blue

Next, you need to set flags 1 (permanent) and 18 (notake) and put 
the buttons in the room as permanent objects. 

Don't forget to set the exit flags 3,4,5,6, and 7
