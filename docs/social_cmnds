	How to Add a Social Command

So you have discovered a neato social command that was left out
of the Mordor code, and want to make your contribution, eh?
Well, this is how you do it.  We are going to add the "salute"
command.

In global.c you will find a list of all the social commands.  They
look like this:
	{ "dance", 100, action },

duplicate this line with your new command and add it to the list.
	{ "salute", 100, action },

Now open the file action.c and see the syntax for each action command.
Note that some social actions do not need a target, but that others do.
(You can dance by yourself, but you need someone to goose.)  The action
we are adding, salute, could be either.  Let's require a target.

At the end of the file, add these lines:
 
	else if(!strcmp(cmdlist[cmdno].cmdstr, "salute")) {
		if(crt_ptr) {
			OUT4("You salute %m.\n", 
			     "%M stands and salutes you.\n",
			     "%M stands and salutes %m.");
		}
		else
			print(fd, "salute whom?\n");
	}

The last thing you have to do is add the new command to the help file.
Change to the help directory and open the help.100 file.  You will find
a list of all social commands possible.  Insert the word salute.

You're done.  Easy, wasn't it?
