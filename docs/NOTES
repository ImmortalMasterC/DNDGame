This is the command to start the game:  DAR -r &

The latest version of gdb does not work with this code.  Use mdb, a
renamed older version.  Example:  mdb DAR core

 
Compile-time options
====================

  Define the following in the Makefile before compiling to enable the 
following options:


DMALLOC --  This is for serious debugging, or if you are interested in 
looking at the memory usage of Mordor.  You also need to install the 
associated library functions.  See http://www.letters.com/dmalloc for 
more information.
 
PARANOID -- This will block access to all non-RFC1413 accounts.

CHECKDOUBLE -- This will enable a double log checking routine that used 
the files in ~/player/simul.  If you want to block double logging using 
this function you need to create files named after the character you wish 
to block double logging.  In the file put the other names of the persons 
characters.

RECORD_ALL -- This will output all the keystrokes by all players to 
~/log/all_cmd.  Use with caution...  It outputs a lot of data, but is
useful for debugging a crash.

SECURE -- This will block access to broadcasting for all non-RFC1413 
accounts that have not been authorized.  It will also prevent them from 
playing past level 3.

LASTCOMMAND -- This causes WHO to output all players last commands.

SUICIDE -- This keeps track of all suicided characters in ~/log/SUICIDE

COMPRESS -- This enables file compression.  It is on by default and is 
recommended.

FINGERACCT -- This enables the *finger command for DMs.  You must have 
~/bin/fing compiled properly from ~/src/finger.c.

AUTOSHUTDOWN -- This enables automatic shutdowns of the program.

GETHOSTBYNAME -- This enables the system call gethostbyname.
