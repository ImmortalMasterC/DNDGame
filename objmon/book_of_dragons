                  The Book of Dragons
                as transcribed by Charon

Dragons are an ancient, winged reptilian race and are known for their 
size, physical prowess, and magical abilities.  The older dragons are 
among the most powerful creatures in the world and know much about magic 
and history.

There are many subspecies of dragons, but there are three main groups:
the chromatic, gem and metallic dragons.  The chromatic dragons include 
the black, blue, green, red and white dragons.  They are especially evil 
and aggressive.  The gem dragons are the amethyst, crystal, diamond, 
emerald, sapphire, and topaz dragons.  They are neutral with respect to 
good and evil, and are very charismatic and suave masters of persuasion.  
They delight in riddles and puzzles and will often answer a question with 
a riddle.  The gem dragons are smaller and slower than other dragons, but 
also tend to be more intelligent.  The metallic dragons are brass, bronze, 
copper, gold and silver.  They are regarded by wise people as noble and 
good.  Of course, there are other related dragons as well, but these are 
the three primary groups of the ancient order.

All of the different species are believed to have come from the same root
stock thousands of years ago, but now they prefer to stay with their own 
kind.  When evil dragons of different species encounter each other, they 
tend to fight to protect their territories.  The neutral and good dragons 
are more tolerant of each other, and often will meet to discuss common 
problems.  Dragons, especially older ones, are generally solitary due to 
both necessity and preference.

Dragons have adapted easily to their environment and have taken on the 
powers of the four elements; earth, wind, fire and water, which they use 
with great efficiency if they need to fight.  Their thick hide and magical
scales are highly prized by armorers as they can be turned into wonderful 
shields and protective clothing.  They are fearsome predators, and can eat 
anything, but prefer cattle and goats.  The evil chromatic dragons have a
fondness for the taste of humans. 

Although dragons' goals and ideals vary from one subspecies to the next, 
all of them are covetous.  They like to hoard wealth and collect mounds 
of coins and treasures.  They especially like magical items, and like to 
bask in the presence of magicke.  By the time a dragon matures to the great 
wyrm stage it has usually amassed a very large treasure.  Those with large 
hoards are loath to leave them for very long, venturing out only to patrol 
their neighborhoods and to look for food.  Because of the treasure, a 
dragon's lair will almost always be protected by a trap or other means.

Despite their great size, dragons are graceful and competent fliers and 
have excellent speed due to the size of their wings.  They cannot fly at 
a high altitude, however, and seldom get more than a few hundred feet above 
the ground.  Only very rare winds can send them aloft higher than that.

During the Great Battle it was the 13 witches that spoke to the chromatic
dragons and turned them against the humans, elves and dwarves.  To this 
day, the chromatic dragons listen to the council of the coven and consider 
any who oppose them steadfast foe.  At that terrible time in history the 
gem dragons took no stand and decided on a wait and watch posture.  That 
doesn't mean they will side with humans, elves and dwarves, but they are 
not instantly aggressive, either.  The metallic dragons will often seek 
the company of humans and elves, wanting to discuss and argue matters of 
philosphy and history which they will do for days. They care not for the 
dwarf or the giant though, finding them to have little in the way of 
intellectual reserves.

A sub-class of the powerful dragons are the drakes.  Drakes are wingless
and much smaller, some only the size of a large dog, and they tend to be
unpredictable in their attitude to other races.  Sometimes they can be
friendly, but most of the time they are either aloof or aggressive.  
Depending on the time of year they are hatched, they will be of a different
color.  Their hue tends to be pastel rather than the vivid colors of the
chromatic dragons.  The mother of all drakes is Garindrin, an old white
drake who lives in a remote cave that has been recently locked with a rusty 
iron door.

One of the most unusual traits of a dragon is its ability to communicate
using telepathy and its way of looking into the soul of a creature to 
determine its aura.  All dragons possess a natural clairaudience and most 
can detect invisible objects and creatures.  Some dragons know secrets that 
only Styx is aware of, and some say Styx gave them the secrets.

They are truly enchanted and powerful!
