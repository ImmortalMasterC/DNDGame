		Only one fighter at a time is allowed in the 
		Single Combat Arena.  None of the combatants in 
		there are aggressive.  
		From one to three fighters may enter the Team 
		Combat Arena.  The team will find an aggressive 
		level 15 minotaur and a non-aggressive mountain 
		giant ready to battle, so be prepared.
		Behind the red door are three high level beasts,
		and all of them are aggressive.  There is no 
		limit to the number of fighters that may enter
		the main arena behind that door, but the more you
		have, the more likely you are to be successful.
		No magic is allowed in the combat areas, so be
		sure you have plenty of vigor potions, as wands
		will not work in there.  Be warned, you won't be 
		able to cast a vigor spell.
		Nothing gets dropped by the losers, but you will 
		gain extra experience points for winning.
		The management of the Truxton Arena appreciates 
		your participation.
