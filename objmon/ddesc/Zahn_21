	The ugly she-goat falls to the floor while a fearsome
	shadow emerges and envelopes you.  Zahn calls on her
	master Zeth to take her to him, as she dies on the
	floor of his temple.  A wash of pain and misery floods
	the room, but also a mix of pleasure, as Zahn knows
	she will return more powerful than before.
	Alith has taken notice of your deed, as has Zeth.
