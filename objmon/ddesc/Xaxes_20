	A loud wail of pain and misery goes up as Xaxes expires!
	But there is the sound of pleasure as well, as Xaxes knows
	he will be reborn, through the glory of Zeth, with more
	power than he had before.  Each time Xaxes gives his life
	for Zeth, he returns stronger than before.  The pain is
	in the death itself, and the misery comes from the long
	separation from his beloved Zahn.
