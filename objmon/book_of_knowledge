The Book of Knowledge recounts a short history of Darbonne, the floating 
city, and provides the reader with enough knowledge to make a wise choice 
as to his class and race.  Choose carefully, for your decisions will affect 
your ability to reach the highest levels.

Before history was written in books the earth was inhabited by all manner
of men and beings, some choosing the lawful and good ways while others 
sought only power and riches through the forces of evil.  Two of the most
powerful and evil forces in the Land of Mordor were the witches and the
Balrogs.  Thirteen witches in all, they commanded the hued dragons and
made them aggressive to most others.  The metallic dragons, being of higher
intellect, reserved their loyalty and remained neutral in the fierce battles
between good and evil.  There came a time when the colored dragons, under 
the control of the wicked thirteen, joined forces with the Balrogs to attack
the cities of the elves, humans and dwarves.  The dragons came from the 
skies and the Balrogs came from the dark caverns below ground in an attempt
to once and for all destroy the goodness in the world.  At the battle of
Eldamar, in the city of Darbonne, it seemed they would triumph, and only at
the darkest hour was the city saved.  Two wizards, one an elf and the other
a dwarf, found the human white mage who could complete the Triage necessary 
to cast a perpetual spell on the city.  The spell lifted the city and the
surrounding countryside high into the sky, higher than any dragon could fly.
Much of the earth beneath the city was taken as well, and the city became 
an island in the air, forever drifting with the wind and the breezes above 
the Land of Mordor.  Unfortunately, there was great destruction near the
edges of the spell and one of the libraries was destroyed.  The contents
of the library were shredded and scattered to the winds, lost forever it
seemed.  The most valuable losses were the parchments and scrolls upon which 
were recorded the incantations for powerful offensive spells from the realms 
of Earth, Wind, Fire and Water.  Now, in this, the Third Age, long after the 
battle was fought and the city was lifted, mighty adventurers still seek 
those fragments, hoping to return them to Alith for safe keeping and, 
perhaps, receive a reward for their brave efforts.

A brief description of the classes is given below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


ALCHEMIST
	An alchemist is capable of transmuting objects into gold, recharging 
	magical wands, and restoring the glow in silver weapons.
	The alchemist is also able to detect magic in objects that others 
	may not see.

	          Skills:   Transmute, Detect magic, Glow, Recharge
	Prime Requisites:   Intelligence, Dexterity
	  Suggested Race:   Dark-Elf










**************************************************************************

ASSASSIN
	An assassin is one who lurks in shadows, waiting to quickly 
	dispatch his or her victim.  Assassins are noted for their 
	ability to back-stab and deal incredible amounts of damage, 
	or even a quick death, with the first blow.  The assassin can 
	hide better than most other classes.

	          Skills:   Sneak, Back-stab
	Prime Requisites:   Dexterity, Strength
	  Suggested Race:   Orc









**************************************************************************

BARBARIAN
	Raised in the harsh lands of tribal villages, barbarians are hearty
	warriors capable of sustaining blow after heavy blow from opponents.  
	Barbarians can bash an opponent, rendering them stunned for a while 
	and unable to attack.  The barbarian can also circle an opponent, an 
	excellent tactic used during a fight.

	          Skills:   Bash, Circle
	Prime Requisites:   Strength, Constitution
	  Suggested Race:   Ogre, Half-Giant









**************************************************************************

BARD
	Bards are clever and resourceful, increasing in lore and knowledge 
	as they gain in level.  The more scholarly bards can entertain an 
	entire room with a song which will invigorate all.  Also, bards have 
	been known to charm friends so completely that they are beyond harm.  
	They can also often charm their foes.  A bard is capable of divining 
	the level of luck a person may have.  Luck can be a strong factor in 
	the outcome of some events, and knowing your level of luck may be 
	quite important.

	          Skills:   Charm, Sing, Fortune telling
	Prime Requisites:   Piety
	  Suggested Race:   Half-elf






**************************************************************************

CLERIC
	The cleric is the most powerful of the classes in the arts of
	healing.  In addition to the ability to heal, the cleric can turn 
	the undead.  Clerics can also achieve magical powers only bested 
	by a mage, and in some cases can cast spells that even a mage 
	cannot achieve.  The cleric can teach certain spells to others.

	          Skills:   Teach, Turn, Pray
	Prime Requisites:   Piety
	  Suggested Race:   Gnome, Human









**************************************************************************

DRUID
	The druid is a master of the health arts.  As the druid is immune 
	to poison and disease, he or she can often go where others would 
	fail.  The druid is neutral, and can thus make use of both good 
	and evil objects.  The druid is a priest of nature, and is at home 
	in the forests and wilds.  The druid can speak to some animals and
	understand their speech.  The ability to gaze means they can see 
	into areas beyond their immediate surroundings.

	          Skills:   Gaze, Teach, Animal speech, Poison immunity
	Prime Requisites:   Constitution, Piety
	  Suggested Race:   Gnome







**************************************************************************

FIGHTER
	The fighter is a master of weaponry and fighting arts.  An advanced
	fighter will achieve great proficiency in the use of weapons, and 
	above the third level will never fumble a weapon.  The fighter can 
	circle opponents.

	          Skills:    Circle, Weapon proficiency
	Prime Requisites:    Strength, Dexterity
	  Suggested Race:    Half-Giant










**************************************************************************

MAGE
	A master of the magic arts, the mage will gain the power to unleash 
	incredible amounts of damage by means of spells, although magic alone 
	cannot overcome all enemies.  A mage can teach low level spells to 
	other people, once the mage has learned them.  In addition, the mage 
	is the only class that is able to enchant items or use the highest 
	level spells.

	          Skills:   Teach, Enchant, Spells
	Prime Requisites:   Intelligence
	  Suggested Race:   Elf








**************************************************************************

MONK
	The monk is adept at hand-to-hand combat and can kill with only a
	touch.  The hands of a monk are as deadly as any weapon wielded by 
	others.  Monks should not remain neutral, but should instead invest
	themselves in true goodness or true evilness in order to make full
	use of their abilities.

	          Skills:   Touch, Pick locks
	Prime Requisites:   Dexterity
	  Suggested Race:   Orc










**************************************************************************

PALADIN
	The Paladin is a brave warrior of faith, and must continue to be
	good aligned in order to inflict damage.  An evil Paladin suffers 
	greatly, but a good Paladin gains extra strength from his faith.  
	The Paladin is a powerful warrior and healer, and like clerics, 
	can turn the undead.

	          Skills:   Turn, Pray, Weapons proficiency
	Prime Requisites:   Strength, Piety
	  Suggested Race:   Human









**************************************************************************

RANGER
	The ranger is a skillful fighter with the abilities to hide, to 
	track both opponents and friends, and to search for things hidden 
	such as monsters, treasures, and exits.  A ranger can hasten, and 
	thus attack faster than other classes.  Rangers are necessary for 
	some of the quests, as tracking can be required in some areas.  
	Rangers are also skilled linguists able to speak any language and, 
	like druids, can talk to some animals.  They can also talk to 
	aggressive monsters without making them angry.  The ability to gaze
	means they can see into areas beyond their immediate surroundings.

	          Skills:   Gaze, Track, Haste, Languages
	Prime Requisites:   Dexterity
	  Suggested Race:   Half-Orc, Hobbit





**************************************************************************

THIEF
	A thief is a very valuable player in any group of adventurers,
	and in some cases, necessary.  A thief is capable of picking 
	locks and stealing from opponents, and has the ability to sneak 
	undetected from place to place.  Like the assassin, a thief can 
	also back-stab.
   
	          Skills:   Steal, Pick locks, Peek, Back-stab, Sneak
	Prime Requisites:   Dexterity
	  Suggested Race:   Hobbit









**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
THE RACES:

There are many races in the Undying Lands and Middle Earth, and any race
may become any of the classes listed above.  However, some races are better
suited for particular classes than others.  A member of a small and agile 
race makes a good thief, where large races tend to be good warriors.  
Intelligence is prized amongst mages, but unnecessary for some of the 
other classes.  Be wise to the fact that all classes have their strengths 
and weaknesses, and that a group of warriors will get no further than a 
group of mages, since cooperation between classes is vital to everyone's 
success.  If you are just beginning your quests and adventures in the
Land of Mordor and have not yet invested much in your character, consider
a suicide and rebuilding your character for optimum attributes.  Choose
your class and race wisely as it will help you advance quicker.


The races are divided into three major categories of small, medium and
large.  Some weapons and armor are meant only for particular sized races,
and there are places where only members of small or large races can enter.
Descriptions of the various races are shown below.

**************************************************************************

DARK ELF - Medium race
	A dark elf is a dreaded, evil member of the Drow and is a 
	creature with dark skin and pale, white hair.  Like all elves, 
	they have high dexterity but lower constitution than men.  
	They are very intelligent and make good alchemists, mages
	and thieves.

	Adjustments:
		Intelligence +1
		Dexterity +1
		Constitution -1








**************************************************************************

DWARF - Small race
	A dwarf is strong but stocky and small, standing less than
	four feet tall.  Dwarves are sturdy fighters, and are known 
	to be stubborn and practical, never really trusting magic or
	anything they cannot see and hold.  They can see in the dark.

	Adjustments:
		Strength +1
		Constitution +1
		Piety -1









**************************************************************************

ELF - Medium race
	Somewhat shorter than humans, the elf is of weaker
	constitution and higher intelligence.  They often have
	a high interest in things magic and can see easily in
	the dark.  They are excellent mages and alchemists.

	Adjustments:
		Intelligence +2
		Constitution -1










**************************************************************************

GNOME - Small race
	A small cousin of the dwarf, gnomes tend to be nimble and
	and quick.  They are often multi-talented and make excellent
	clerics or thieves.  (Is there a difference?)
	 
	Adjustments:
		Piety +1
		Dexterity +1
		Strength -1










**************************************************************************

CENTAUR - Large race
	Centaurs are magnificent creatures, being half man and half
	horse.  They combine the naturally high constitution of both
	races, and are exceptionally hard to kill.  They tend to be
	socially oriented, and like to be in the company of others.
	They have been known to kill their enemies with only their
	hooves.

	Adjustments:
		Constitution +2
		Intelligence -1








**************************************************************************

HALF-ELF - Medium race
	A cross between the elven and human races, a half-elf can 
	become a master in any class.  In the case where the father 
	was human and the mother was elven, these half-elves are 
	also known as wandering elves.

	Adjustments:
		Intelligence +1
		Piety +1
		Constitution -1









**************************************************************************

HALF-GIANT - Large race
	A cross between the giant and human races, a half-giant
	is brutally strong and makes a very good warrior.  In all
	known cases, the mother was a giant and the father was human.
	They are genial, but often not very smart.

	Adjustments:
		Strength +2
		Intelligence -1










**************************************************************************

HALF-ORC - Medium race
	Half-Orcs are the products of humans and orcs, but not a
	very pretty combination.  They tend to be smarter than the
	normal orc, and have tremendous strength, but they lack the
	constitution of their parents.

	Adjustments:
		Dexterity +1
		Constitution +1
		Piety -1









**************************************************************************

HOBBIT - Small race
	Small and agile, the hobbit is especially dexterious and 
	likes to live close to nature.  Although well known to
	others as hobbits, they prefer to be called by their chosen 
	name of halfling.  They have very quick hands, and make 
	excellent thieves and pick-pockets.
	
	Adjustments:
		Dexterity +2
		Strength -1









**************************************************************************

HUMAN - Medium race
	What is man?  Who knows?  And if you are actually reading
	this, perhaps you should stop mudding for about a week, and
	read philosophy.

	Adjustments:
		Constitution +1












**************************************************************************

OGRE - Large race
	Adult ogres can stand nine to ten feet tall, although they do
	not generally have the body mass of a half-giant.  They mingle
	freely with giants and trolls, and often serve as mercenaries.
	They have thick hides which makes them difficult to kill.  They
	have little use for priests or shamen.

	Adjustments:
		Strength +1
		Constitution +1
		Piety -1








**************************************************************************

ORC - Medium race
	Orcs are fierce warriors and look much like primitive humans
	with greenish-grey skin.  Orcs have a fierce loyalty to their
	tribe, but are suspicious of all others.  They are very strong 
	and quick, and easily learn to use weaponry.

	Adjustments:
		Strength +1
		Dexterity +1
		Intelligence -1









**************************************************************************

SATYR - Medium race
	The Satyr is part man and part goat, and you will have to decide
	which part is which.  If you've heard the expression "horny as a
	billy goat," you will know where it comes from after seeing a Satyr.
	They are nimble and quick of foot, and in the Land of Mordor, they
	serve Alith, the Great White Holy Goat.

	Adjustments:
		Constitution -1
		Dexterity +1
		Piety +1		



**************************************************************************

GENDER - Male or female
	You may choose to be either without much consequence, but
	each has one advantage when you create a character.  Males
	are given an extra point for strength and females are given
	an extra point for dexterity.  Most objects can be used by
	either sex, but there are a few that are gender-specific.
	There are also a few entry/exits that are only available to 
	one gender or the other.

Where to begin:
	There are several areas designed for beginning adventurers,
	look for these in the areas surrounding the Memorial Park, 
	and in the pubs and inns.  You will find plenty of areas to 
	get you started.  You should also talk to monsters, as they 
	can often tell you important information concerning the 
	floating city and the land below.


Chaotic players:
	For those who choose to be chaotic, be forewarned.  you
	will be able to attack and steal from other players, but
	also can be attacked and stolen from.  From time to time, 
	a powerful chaotic character may decide to wreak havoc upon 
	anyone of a lower level, and thus vulnerable to him or her.  
	Remember then, that if you choose to be chaotic, you must 
	accept both its benefits and its penalties.  Do not whine 
	about being killed.  It is so unseemly.
	The Dungeonmasters, being the kind and sensitive people they 
	are, will allow you to change from chaotic to lawful once in 
	your life, if you have seen the light and wish to mend your 
	sinful ways.  However, in some cases the change-over may 
	require a court appearance and you may have to suffer the 
	retribution of your peers as they bring judgment against
	you.  It is almost always worth it, however.







Luck:
	There are seven levels of luck ranging from extremely bad to 
	exceptionally good.  Most players are at about level 5 which
	is the average value.  A character's luck changes often during 
	the course of play, and is randomly assigned at each login.  
	If your luck falls below level 3, you will find yourself under 
	a very black cloud indeed.  At level 1 every bird in the city 
	will make a target of you when the urge to shit occurs.  If you 
	ever go above level 7, you can almost walk on water.  Thieves 
	and assassins tend to be luckier than other classes, while 
	clerics and Paladins are often below average.  There are objects 
	in the Land of Mordor that can either improve or reduce one's luck.  
	To be effective, they must be held or worn.  Simply being in your 
	inventory does not affect you.





A comment on quests and quest items:
	Once you have attained your third title, you may want to begin 
	looking for quest items and begin completing the quests. Only 
	a few fragments of the master scrolls have ever been recovered.
	If you find one, take it to the Temple of Alith where you will 
	be properly rewarded.  
	Do _NOT_ give a quest item to others.  There is a severe penalty 
	and no appeal from the punishment.  Ignorance of this restriction
	does not excuse a player.

Rules:
	Not many.  Playing more than one character is encouraged, and you
	can play two characters simultaneously, but when the game is full
	and other players are waiting in the queue, logoff one of your 
	characters.  (Else I will take all of your characters off.)
	And please... do not give quest items to others.  I really hate that. 
	Most other rules I tend to makeup as I see they are needed.  If you 
	make a jerk of yourself, you may find me getting pissed off.  You 
	don't want that.
	If you find a bug in the code or you have a suggestion to improve 
	the game, let me know.  If you exploit a bug for your own gain, I
	will probably lock out your site from ever playing again.
	Enjoy Darbonne and the friends you will make here, but don't forget 
	to do your homework!!  You may contact me via any of the Darbonne 
	post offices.
