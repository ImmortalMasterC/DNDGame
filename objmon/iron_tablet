	|  Come now, before Zeth the Black Goat and his First Servants,  |
	|  Xaxes and Zahn, to renounce the ways of the good and the      |
	|  lawful.  Those who choose the chaotic path will be protected  |
	|  henceforth by Zeth, and will be rewarded for their allegience |
	|  to evil.  There is a price to pay, and you must be at least	 |  
	|  level five to come across the Great Rift.  You will pay 10%	 |
	|  of your experience points, so be very sure of what you are	 |
	|  doing.  When you are ready to join Zeth and his many servants,|
	|  you must go naked into the very center of this dark pit and   | 
	|  hold the Great Black Goat Horns you find there.  Before you	 |
	|  enter, however, be sure you speak to Xaxes and Zahn so you	 |
	|  are aware of the requirements.  You are warned.               |
	|                                                   -Styx-       |
