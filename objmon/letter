	My dearest father;
		As the eldest of your many daughters, I am writing
	this to you while speaking for my younger sisters.  We are
	aware that our dear departed mother's last wish was that 
	we would all wed and have homes of our own.
	She also respected the customs of our grandparents that
	daughters should marry only after the eldest has found
	a proper husband, and you swore on her deathbed you would
	uphold that custom.  Now, my sisters are doomed.  I cannot
	marry, and so they cannot.  I loved but one, and he has
	been unfaithful to me.  He has taken a harlot, from the
	house in Quickhand known as Madame Ruthies, and now lives
	with her in quarters above that vile place.  Forgive us,
	father, for we know you have not long to live and would
	like to die in peace, but we have sworn an oath to partake
	of the brew made by Galgatha the witch.  It will sustain
	us even after our own deaths so that we may wreak revenge
	on all men, and torment their souls even as ours are torn.
	Woe be to the man who ever enters this Mercater house again!
		Mordicia
