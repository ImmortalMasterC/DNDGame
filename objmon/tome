		|   In this book it is written that all those   |
		|   brothers who serve Alith may train here in  |
		|   this monestery so that they may advance to  |
		|   further fight the forces of Zeth.           |
		|                                               |
		|   If you are a brother monk who has chosen    |
		|   to ally yourself with Zeth, the evil one,   |
		|   and are above the level of six, then with   |
		|   great sorrow we must send you out into the  |
		|   rain and cold.  You cannot train here.      |
		|   We have heard rumors of a black temple in   |
		|   the city of Lindon which may welcome you,   |
		|   but of that we are unsure.                  |
		|                                               |
		|   We pray thee, evil brother, do not tarry    |
		|   here, but either change your aura or find   |
		|   the Temple of Zeth.                         |
		|                                               |
