----------The Book of Loki ----------

Loki lived during a time of great
danger. In order to survive, Loki
assumed a double identity,
serving opposite sides of opposing
parties. Loki often used lies and
deceit to survive. Eventually, it
became his way of life.

This text serves to  help those who
wish to solve his platform maze
near Greenwood. Many adventurers who
so cleverly figured out the correct
step pattern continued to fail the
maze.  This is due to the nature of
the platforms themselves.

In order to succeed, the adventurer
must understand that the moving
colored platforms are themselves
a mirage. Seeing is not believing.
To overcome this problem, the adventurer
must look carefully.

Each colored platform emits a subtle
"ghost" image. This ghost image is a faded
version of the platform. For example,
the red platform emits a redish ghost, the
green platform emits a greenish ghost, and
so forth.  In order to succeed, the 
adventurer must know the steps and walk
very carefully, making sure to step to the
platform's ghost, and not the platform
itself. Mark carefully these words.
