25 Apr 2002 - Notice to everyone: Do NOT have the same passwd for other
muds because somehow Lotus got hold of your passwds (I have proof that he
hacked at LEAST a dozen chars).  Change your darbonne passwd right now. I
also want you to tell us (mudmail Cirion or myself) which other muds you
had the same passwds as your darbonne char's passwd (I have two suspects)
so we can take care of this.  Also, from here on out, I suggest that you
do NOT share your chars with anyone to avoid this kind of crap in the
future.  -Miphon
