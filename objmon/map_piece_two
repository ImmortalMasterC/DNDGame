Druid Training for advanced levels are located in the maze.

The Explanation is as follows:

1.  The numbers that are seen are training rooms with which the druid must
    go to in order to train.  For levels 16-20, the locations on the map
    are training rooms in and of themselves.

2.  For levels 21-24, a key will be needed.  The key itself is guarded by
    a witch.  A = or || is shown showing from which side you must unlock
    the exit from.

3.  To reach level 25, you must go to the center of the maze and defeat
    the minotaur.  He guards the exit to the final training room.  Again,
    a key must be used to unlock the exit to the training room.
