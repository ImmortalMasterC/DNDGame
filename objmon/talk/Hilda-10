Would you like information on how to train, or perhaps where to train?  Or would you like to discuss transmuting objects to gold?  Also, I can teach you to detect any magic in objects.

train
If you are less than level six, you may train here.  Advanced alchemists must journey to Chandre.  You do know how much experience you need to enter the training rooms, I hope.  Also, you must purchase a key from me.
key
Each training room requires a different key.  The higher the level of advancement, the more expensive the key.  Please look at the plaque.
advanced
If you wish to train beyond level six, you must find the School of Alchemy in the northern sector of Chandre.  The school is located on the university campus.
chandre
Chandre is the mountain home of the elves.  You must leave Darbonne and make a perilous journey to get there.
school
The School of Alchemy is found in Chandre, near the eastern gate in the northern sector.
transmute
Can you not turn objects to gold?  Have I wasted all this education and training on you?  Simply say, "transmute <object>" and it will become gold.  Of course, the higher level you become, the better the quality of work.
magic
If you go to the attic, you will see my box of scrolls there.  Take one and study it if you wish to learn how to detect-magic.
