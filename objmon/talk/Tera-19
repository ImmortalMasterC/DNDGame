targon
King Targon led his band of heroes in the Battle of Unending Tears against the Witch of Elmoren.
battle
It was indeed a great battle, and Targon and his group fought well, but it is not called the Battle of Unending Tears because it had a happy ending.
tears
The Battle of Unending Tears?  Yes, that was the battle where Ereborea and her younger sister led the rear guard and fought so well.
sister
Ereborea's sister name was Arigreil, and she was the younger, but she was as fierce as a balrog in her defense of her king.
ereborea
She led the rear guard, and both she and her sister were turned to stone by the Witch of Elmoren, but not until they had defeated a much larger company of mountain trolls and two dragons.
arigreil
She was only a lass, but she fought as well as her sister, Ereborea, and both were turned to stone by the witch.
witch
The Witch of Elmoren?  After she turned the sisters to stone she was too weak to return home and spent at least 200 years hidden in a valley where she tried to recuperate.  No one knows where she is now, but some report she has been seen.
unending
Did I not say it was the Battle of Unending Tears?  We still weep for King Targon and his brave band.
