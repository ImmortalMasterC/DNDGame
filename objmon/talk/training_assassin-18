papers
yes, I need certain papers which will indicate you have accomplished your assignment.  If you have them, I can trade you a training key.  If you do not, perhaps you should speak to Guild Master Tobias.
tobias
The Guild Master is in the office.  Go out to the anteroom and you will see where it is.  You must speak to him about the requirements for training.
master
The Guild Master's office is out there in the anteroom.  You must go out and speak to him.
key
You need a key to open the training room door, and I will only give you a key in trade for certain papers that we need.  Why don't you speak to the Master Assassin in the office?
trade
I will trade you a key for papers that the Guild wishs to have for political purposes.  The keys I have will open the doors to the training rooms.
train
You will need a key to enter the training room, and I will only trade you a key for specific papers.  Perhaps you should speak to Guild Master Tobias.
yellow
The yellow door leads to a training room for level four assassins.  You will need a yellow training key to enter.  If you bring me a sealed envelope from the labor hall, I will trade you the key for the envelope.
green
The green door is for level five training.  I need a jobs list from the foreman at the labor hall, so therefore I am willing to trade you the key to the yellow door for that list.
blue
There are two ways of entering the blue door.  I will trade you a key for a missing onyx carving which a client has requested that we recover.  We believe the piece is hidden in the basement of the labor hall.  The second way is for you to assassinate one of the Grimley brothers.  If you kill one of the Grimley brothers and bring the head to Master Tobias, he will trade you a note for it.  Bring the note to me and I will trade you a key to the blue training room.
grimley
Master Tobias can tell you the story of the Grimley brothers.  *spit*
