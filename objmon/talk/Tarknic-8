sky
I've flown over all of Mordor and I have seen the Crystal Palace and the Black Palace.
palace
Which palace?  There are many!  Please don't bother me with such inane questions.
crystal
Ah, you speak of the Crystal Palace!  Have you been there?  I saw it from a distance while in a storm.  I was flying with a Copper Dragon!  Can you imagine?
black
I warn you, do not go near the Black Palace.  An evil almost as great as Zeth himself resides there, and he is hungry for blood.
