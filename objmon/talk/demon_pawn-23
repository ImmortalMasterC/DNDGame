For what level?  Be quick with your response!  I have better things to do than stand here and watch your dawdle all day.
nineteen
We are gathering treasure from all over the Land of Mordor.  Your first task shall be to return with a diamond stickpin, then trade it with me for a key to your training room.  Hopefully this isn't too difficult for someone that looks as stupid as you.
stickpin ACTION smack
Must I hold your hand while you do this?  Very well, but don't expect me to tell you where everything is after this.  Those who frequent a brothel are said to have possession of these.  Now, off with you!
twenty
Trade me a jade pendant for a key for the door.
pendant ACTION sigh
Yes!  It's made of jade.  This time I'll not tell you where to find it.  You're on your own, you little imp!
twenty-one
Bring me a clear jewel.  Make sure it's a large one at that.  I don't have to tell you what clear jewel I ask for, do I?
jewel ACTION grumble
Seek the little blue ones.  The female holds the jewel of which I speak.
twenty-two ACTION cackle
Huzzah!  I no longer have to deal with your incompetence.  Head to the anteroom and talk to the demon you find there.
