You speak of our master so lightly.  Perhaps you have never experienced the power of the Holy Goat.  It was he who made me the Keeper of the Master Scroll.

There are three immortals, but Alith binds them together.  An old elf, Trinnadar, is the wisest.  Emstillion the dwarf has the heart and courage of a lion, and Elisha, the beautiful human, the sensitivity of a lover's caress.
scroll
The Master Scroll was torn asunder long ago, and now exists only as small fragments.  I and my assistants have been attempting to piece it together again.  Do you by chance have a fragment of the parchment?
master
It no longer exists.  Now only small fragments can be found, and then only by lucky adventurers.  My assistants help me in my endeavors to reassemble it.
fragment ACTION bow
If you have a fragment, I will have my assistant reward you handsomely.  I will trade you a key to one of my research rooms if you have a fragment.  Speak to my one of my assistants you find there.
