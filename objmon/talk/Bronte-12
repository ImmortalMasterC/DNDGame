city
Long ago before the great war, many merchants far and wide came to trade, and adventurers sought refuge, at a once bustling city north of Darbonne.  People from every end of mordor made pilgrimage to the great citadel of Soledad, which was a famous city for paladins of the Azure Hearts.  The city flourished and grew over time.  This was the before history was made.

During the time of Witches and Balrogs, the city of Soledad was attacked by the undead and demons.  At that time the Azure Hearts protected the great citadel.  A great battle took place there as the paladins fought bravely for days.  Bodies of young paladins and demons could be found left and right, covering the streets of the holy city in blood.

As the battle ensued, the paladins grew weary and the demons were able to break through the center of Soledad towards the citadel.  The general of the dread naughts, an evil man named Gustav, headed into the citadel in an attempt to destroy the city's symbol of hope.  In the heart of the citadel, a young paladin by the name of Melrose was praying to Alith.  Gustav found her and so began their fight.

Young and inexperienced Melrose was quickly felled by Gustav, recieving a mortal wound.  Before Gustav could deliver his final blow, a blinding beam of light was said to penetrate the buildint and lit up Melrose's armor, blinding Gustav in a flash of light.  It gave Melrose enough time to pierce his throat with her lance, as he fell to die, shadows consuming his body.  She then fell to one knee and passed on, as the monsters ravaged the ruined city.  The city became chaotic and disorganized, hence the gods set Melrose to protect the citadel, and keep the monsters left from the battle trapped forever within the city.  If not for Melrose and the many paladins who gave their lives, the army would have made it through to Darbonne.
