here
Yes, here in the temple.  Don't you hear well?  Try to listen more carefully.  Now, why are you here?
temple
This temple is dedicated to but one purpose.  Zeth is taking tributes from those who desire the chaotic life.
chaotic
If you enter the tomb, you will find Xaxes and Zahn, who can tell you how to become chaotic.
tomb
Can't you see?  Pay attention.  Go to the tomb and speak to both Xaxes and Zahn.
xaxes
You will find him in the tomb with his mate, Zahn the she-goat.
zahn
She is the stronger and smarter of the two, although Xaxes doesn't know it.
zeth
Bow deeply when you say the name of Zeth, the Black Goat!  I believe him to be more powerful than his brother, Alith.
alith
You mean that goody-good goat?  Bah.  If it were not that he and Zeth were kids together, Zeth would have banished him long ago.
