I believe I've found an ancient sheepskin that was once in the library.

If you do me a favor I will consider giving it to you, as this is a copy.

Go to Chandre, and find my brother Rizon.

Ask him to give you a green heater, and bring it to me, please.  I will trade you the sheepskin for it.

It is so I can resume exploring here without freezing to death.

I left a magical heater with my brother and now I need it to continue exploring.
