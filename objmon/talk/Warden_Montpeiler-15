xerxes
He is here, in this very prison.  The king himself ordered his imprisonment.
king
The king is very unhappy with Xerxes because he believes the old fool knows where several Master Scrolls are located.
prison
Ha!  You stand almost upon his head at this very moment.  This prison will keep him forever.
scrolls
Yes, scrolls I said.  Xerxes knows the location but he will not tell the king.
stand
Only I have the key to the cell of Xerxes.  We stand over him even now.
fool
He is a fool because he will never see the light of day unless he tells the king where the scrolls can be found.
unhappy
Well, Xerxes was the king's librarian you know.  He is unhappy because he felt Xerxes betrayed him.
betrayed
Hmmph.  He learned of the scrolls in the king's library from the king's books, yet would not tell the king.  That's betrayal.
library
Have you ever seen it?  it's in the north tower, you know.
tower
The north tower?  that's where Xerxes used to work when he was the librarian for the king's court.
court
That was a long time ago, you know.  Most everyone has forgotten Xerxes by now.
cell
Xerxes has a comfortable cell below us, but he is a stubborn old fool.
location
I really don't know.  Xerxes has never confided in me, but I suspect he wants to tell someone before he dies.
dies
He is the oldest prisoner we have and probably will die here, taking his knowledge of the scrolls with him.
knowledge
Did I not say?  He knows where several Master Scrolls can be found, yet he will not tell the king.
