order
Oh, dear, I haven't finished that order yet.  I ran out of the special wax.
wax
Some candle makers are hoarding this years supply.  Perhaps you could bring back some so that I might finish the order.
candle
I make very fine candles, but the brothers require a special wax that is very long lasting.
hoard
I don't do that, but others do and now I have none of the special wax to fulfill the brothers order.
