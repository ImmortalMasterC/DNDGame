orchard
This orchard was the pride of Gregorian the Ancient before he disappeared.  Nobody knows if he is dead or alive, but he left a sum of gold to have this orchard preserved in his name if he was ever missing.
gregorian
An ancient dryad he was, and may still be, but nobody knows where he is.  He went to the center of the orchard one day, and has never returned.
witch
The Witch of Fear?  Yes, we believe she lives in the gully near the center of the orchard, but we have never wanted to verify it.  The closer one gets to the gully, the more fearful we become.
gully
If you insist on going, take the old path and always bear left when you have a choice.  You will come to the gully, but it may not be wise.  We believe a witch lives there.
center
That's where the gully runs through the orchard.  We don't go there.
