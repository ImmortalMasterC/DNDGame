leave
That is something you will not be doing!
alive
No, no, you will most certainly not be alive.  However, you will not be dead, either, but will stay and serve me when you are not in one of the graves outside.  Maggia will be delighted help me.
grave
They are the earthen homes of my undead servants, and one of them will soon be your home.  My sister, Maggia, will turn your bones for me.

outside
I am the Earth Witch, sometimes called the stone witch, and all of the outside is my domain.  All that grows and all that is beneath the growth is mine.  That fool Tarnan thought I could give up such power.
maggia
She is the Witch of the Undead, and she is my sister.  When I have killed you, she will revive you, but not to your former self.  Cackle!!!
tarnan
Bah.  A foolishly blind lover.  My sister, Maggia, plays with his body, reviving him over and over.  I love to kill him, as I will you.
