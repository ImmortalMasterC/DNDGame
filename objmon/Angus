Angus MacDougal MacLear

The sons of Stonehaven were hardy and bold,
And quite unaccustomed to fear,
But the bravest of these was a dwarf, I am told
Named Angus MacDougal MacLear.

This son of the mines, in battle aroused,
Could spit twenty trolls on his spear.
A terrible creature, both sober and soused
Was Angus MacDougal MacLear.

When they needed a sword to encourage the van,
Or to harass the foe from the rear,
Or to storm a redoubt, they had only to shout,
For Angus MacDougal MacLear.

Now in another part of Darbonne I have reliant,
There was a muscular pride without par.
Half human and half giant,
He was Count Igor Birenski Skitar.

There are heros aplenty and giants known to fame
in the Hillmen that were led by the Chieftain Gustar;
But the bravest of these was a giant by the name
Of Igor Birenski Skitar.

He could imitate Fenrus, play Euchre and pool
And perform on the Spanish Guitar.
In fact, quite the cream of the muscular team
Was Igor Birenski Skitar.

The ladies all loved him, his rivals were few;
He could drink them all under the bar.
As gallant or tank, there was no one to rank
With Igor Birenski Skitar.

One day this bold Hillman had shouldered his mace
And donned his most truculent sneer.
Stonehaven he did go, where he trod on the toe
Of Angus MacDougal MacLear.

"Young man," quoth MacDougal, "has life grown so dull,
That you're anxious to end your career?
Vile mountain!  Know you have trod on the toe
Of Angus MacDougal MacLear?"

"So take your last look at the sunshine and brook
And send your regrets to the Czar;
By this I imply you are going to die,
Sir Igor Birenski Skitar."

Quoth Igor, "my friend, your remarks in the end,
Will avail you but little I fear,
For you never will survive to repeat them alive,
Little Angus MacDougal MacLear."

Then this bold Angus of dwarves drew his trusty lancet
With a roar and cry of "Alith, have at!"
And with murderous intent, he ferociously went
For Igor Birenski Skitar.

Then they parried and thrust and they side-stepped and cussed
Till their blood would have filled a great pot.
The philologist blokes, who seldom crack jokes,
Say that hash was first made on that spot.

They fought all that night, 'neath the pale yellow moon;
The din, it was heard from afar;
And great multitudes came, so great was the fame
Of Angus and Igor Skitar.

As Angus' long knife was extracting a life -
In fact he was shouting "Huzzah!" - -
He felt the impale by that mountainous male,
Count Igor Birenski Skitar.

The Squire of the clan flew by, on his red-crested fly,
Expecting the victor to cheer;
But he only drew nigh to hear the last sigh
Of Angus MacDougal MacLear.

Chieftain Gustar, too, in his spectacles blue,
Rode up on his new crested steed.
He arrived just in time to exchange a last line
With Igor Birenski Skitar.

A loud-sounding splash from the Danube was heard
Resounding o'er meadows afar;
It came from the sack, fitting closely to the back,
Of Igor Birenski Skitar.

There's a tomb rises up where the blue Danube flows;
Engraved there in characters clear;
"Ah stranger, when passing, please pray to Alith
For Angus MacDougal MacLear."

B
A Hillgiant maiden her lone vigel keeps,
Neath the light of the pale polar star;
And the name she murmurs as oft as she weeps
is Igor Birenski Skitar.
