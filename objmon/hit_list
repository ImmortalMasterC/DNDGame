			     Assassin's Hit List

	For many years now there has been an open contract between 
	some of the city's wealthest business people and the Assassin's 
	Guild to kill those rabble-rousing labor leaders in Quickhand.  
	As you advance in level and gain experience you will be called 
	upon many times to snuff one or more of them.

	As a level two or level three assassin, you are not expected to
	kill any of these enemies of the Guild, but you should observe
	the more senior assassins at work, so that when your time comes,
	you will feel confident in doing the Guild's work.

	In order to advance to level four, you need to obtain an envelope
	carried by one of the old and weak labor leaders.  You can 
	probably find one of them at the Labor Hall in Quickhand.  Bring 
	back the envelope he carries and trade it to the training assassin 
	for a yellow training key.

	For the Guild to advance you to level five, we require that you
	bring us a job list.  Any of the foremen you may find at the labor
	hall probably has one.  We believe it will have the names of those
	work against us, so we would like to see it.  The training assassin
	will be happy to trade you a blue key such a list.
 
	The last advancement at this Guild is for level six.  An onyx 
	carving has been stolen, and a high official desires us to get it 
	back, even if it means assassination.  You may talk to the Guild 
	Master concerning this, but please be discrete.

	For level six, you may also choose to go after any or all of the 
	Grimley brothers who have chosen to operate as assassins without 
	benefit of the Guild.  That makes them just plain murderers!  
	No one knows how many brothers there are, but they are many.  
	Bring back the head of a Grimley and speak only to the Guild 
	Master.  Guild Master Tobias can give you more information 
	concerning where to find these perverts.  Talk to him.
